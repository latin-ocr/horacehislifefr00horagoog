Best strike you, though otherS, if further away be your sta-
tion:
For one an obscurity loves, whilst the next aye the light must
be seen in— ‘
As critics in judgment not fearing, however acute—yet,
· Rejoicing you thus, its own mate will e’en tenfold repeat you

Your mind, that for certain things, half-way and fairish de-
grees are
Of right oft allowed. Thus a counsel·at-law, or a pleader-
Ofcauses, though middling in merit, and far from the

So poemS, though iramed and invented our spirits to
charm, if

A trifle from summits they dip, will tull speedily sink to the
bottom.

In games, one who knows not, from Campus abstains, and its
arms t00,
Or, unskil'd at ball, and with quoits, or the hoops, stays his
380 seat in,
