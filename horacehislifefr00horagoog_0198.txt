much indeed, for one's own epoch, even without the con·
straint of imitation, or of an alien tongue, is of course a
sufficient task for poet artists of the highest rank. ·

On the question of modern adaptation-othsr than
what is necessarily implied by a translation as nearly ap-
proximate, comprehensible, and faithful, as may he-the
monuments of ineptitudo and bad taste which already bar
the way would seem to preclude further affort in this
directior.

That poets of original force have so rarely and so
briofly pursued the narrow and fiowerless paths of trans-
lation and adaptation is douhtless due to an instinctive
perception of the obstructive features here indicated: of
what, in fact, are after all but obvious drawbacks, of a
most elementary character. But, in any case, a true
artist of the kind must necessarily be pre-equipped with
ample material for the stoking of his own fornace. For
such, indeed, the “tightly girthed style of cethegi’s old
fashions'' is neither of long or of serious attraction, even
if not-

Matters of metrical form, and as well the often dis-
cussed questions of ancient quantity, and modern accent,
necessarily cut a considerable figure in the prefaces
of translatore of the Horatian field; the subsequent
experiments of the latter ranging from the fantastic
practice of the late learned Professor Newman-whom
Matthew Arnold fell foul of in the famous essays on
Homer renderings—through all varieties of uncertain,
aud generally disappoiuting, results, down to the some-
what odd effect of the hexameter-echoes of Dr. Bryce's,
otherwise excellent, recent prose work. Iam here oom-
pelled to pass these illuminating examples with but slight

heed, as indeed I have deliberately done in my own
metrical efforts, on the theory that the Horatian metros
are substantially unattainable in English imitatione, and,
