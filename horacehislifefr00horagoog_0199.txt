if too closely copied, are sure to result in unpleasant
vagary, il not in positive grotesqueness. Poe, who al·
though of no great learning, was ot course a great poet,
once wrote a chapter to prove that there is no merit in
minutely conventional rules oi poetic construction, while
others, who were, orare, learned, but not poets, have
compiled books to show that these are sacrosanct. To me
it seems that we have here, and thus, but a further illus-
tration of Omar’s difficulty, albeit in a different field: I
too, have

Horatian models, and therefore takes no account of sundry
well known and generally successful, or at least striking,
accomplishments in respect ol other classic metrical
forms ε such, for example, as Tennyson's “ experiments '',
or the tour de force oi Dr. Robinson Ellis in dealing with
the Oatullus poems. But, even in these instances, there
