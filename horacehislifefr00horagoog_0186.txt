Person Duneter puts it, fer the “lake oi a founding
word.’'

Nor is there in either ol these instances any essential
difference, other than, perhaps, oi degree, although it is
seldom that one oi these gentlemen is found so iar out in
the open, and with such candid disclosure of intent, as
in the case of Mickle.

However this may be, the fact remains that the
rhymers have heretofore had pretty much their own way
in this field of literature, whether in English, or other
modern languages.

Taking the Bibliography ol the Odes and Epodes oi
Horace, which was recently published by the Bibliephile
Society, as a convenient source oi information and com-
parison, it is found that, after eliminating the purely
prose, and critical, as well as educational translatione,
there are therein enumerated some two hundred and two
rbpmcd versione, as againsta trifie of about seven or eight
in blank, or unrhymed verse.

Again, out oi the total oi three hundred and twenty-
five translations ol all sorte which are used in whole, or
in extract, in the seven volumes of the Society’s recent
Horace Edition, only seventeen can be discovered in non-
rhyming, or other than in rhymed metrical form*

Why the rhyming habit has thus so largely prevailed,
and indeed, why it was ever adopted for ihc purpose of
reproduciap uurbpmed oripiuols, are questions with which
we have not here space to deal, however interesting such
matters may be. But it is perhaps worth while to point
out, in passing, that rhyming is generally assumed to
have been horrowed by modern languages from the Latin

*The two interesting publicatione oi the Bibliophile society, here reterred to are
primarlly limited to the Odes and upodes, the Biblipgraphy, however. including sundry
editions oi these which take in additional Horatian materiei. A iurther valnable work,
is about tobe issued hythe Society‚ entitled “One 'i'housand Horatian Quotations” It is
oi interest to obser-ve that out oi the two hundred and two rhymed translation versione,
above referred to as noted in the Bibliography‚ one hundred and thirty-two are in ung.
lieh, there being but tour, in the same languege, in unrhymed metricul iorm.

This relative proportior would appear to exist ln the various other modern lengum
editions which 1 have examined. Thus. a table ot spennh publicatione contained ln tho
standum work oi Don Marcelino Menander y Pelayo: ‘⁸ Heracle en Espaw, gem ῃ
total oi some aaa Spanish (end Portuguese) versione, almost exclusively in rhyme.
