* * * The freedom of arrangement possible in an in-
flected language and required by the exigencies of the metre
yields effects of symmetry, parallelism, antithesis, and inter-
locked order which will be felt by any one who reads the
odes familiarly, but cannot be reproduced in English. As
many as five words may intervene between a noun and its
modifier, and the order within such a group may reproduce
or reverse that of the extremes. In this way a thought is
suspended, a picture is gradually unfolded, a name is reserved
for a climax, etc.'' -Snonnn

“Order of words.'’ (i. e. in the Odes) “An inflected
language admits greater treedom in the arrangement of
words than is possible in one which is uninflected, so that an
idea is often held in suspense until it has been brought into
relation with associated ideas. It is therefore necessary
³* ᾗ * to learn to carry in mind incomplete ideas through
groups of words of varying length. Such groups are common
to both prose and poetry3 n * ³* But in poetry the
arrangement and grouping of words is much more highly
developed(³) ⁴* ⁴* *'' —Moonn
