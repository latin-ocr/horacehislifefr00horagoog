Who struggled in tragedy-verse-a vile goat for his prize-
’ first, 220

Soon also wild Satyrs disclosed too, quite naked, and rasp-

ing as well: next, ·

(His Tragics left saie) made attempts with their jokes, as if, ¹
haply, such methods

of charm and attraction were novel, and apt ior begnilin g

Spectators3 from Rites now discharged, and both drunken
and lawless.

N ay, trnly, such mockerS, thus brought on the scene to say
jestings, ²²5

Behoves it, as Satyra, who ever turn serious matters to ribald,

Not suffer-with whatever god, or what hero that’s showing,

And recently seen in regalia of gold, and the purple—

To far over-step, with a lingo attaint by the reek of a tavem,

And, soaring from Earth, stop to stick in the fogS, or void·
spaees ²30

For Tragedy, falling to treat with due cantion such measures
unworthy,

Is like to some Metron who dances on festival days, by corn-

mand, .

Midst like impudent Satyrs, and not without blnshing to be

there.

Not only unpolished, and most-current ternis ot expression,
and words,

Ο ye PisoS, as Satire Play writer, shall I e'er be fond of3 235

Nor yet effort show to escape from a Tragedy-style, so

That no odds be made whether Davus is speaking, or whether

'Tis Pythias, brahen—who wheedled the talent troni Simo-

Or keeper-and-servant, Silenus (a god for his pnpil)

I'll follow my poem; invented from matter well-known, so
that others ²40

May hope to do likewise themselves tho’ their toil and
sweating, ·
