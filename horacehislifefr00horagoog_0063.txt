Oon Ι. XXVII. (To ffls Commoris.)
Nay! fashion’d to foster rejoicings, these beakers:
'Po clash 0’er them 's Thracian! Off, then, such barbarian
Customs, and let modest Bacchus

From blood stain here sav'd be, and tumult!
Wine too, and lamp's glow-with the Mede's scimetar! 5

Of wizard's art, saves thee—or haply, what god may?
Lo, bound with their toils that are three told,
Scarce Pegasus rends from Chimaeras!

How keen, are stagnated the rivers!
Dispel we the chin, with the logs on the hearth-pile‚ 5
Freely replenish’d 3 alike bring, benignant,
