Fuou Omr 3· VIII. (To Mororum.)

What, on Kalends of March, I, a bachelor, do here;
What flowers thus mean, and this censer with perfumes
Replete, lo, you wonder? Why placed too, are coals now,

The green turi alight on·-
O, you, skilled in works of both lauguagesl-I have, 5
For sacrifice joyous, a vow made: the whitest,
Of goats doom'd to BacchuS, since once I nigh killed was,

By stroke of a tree-fall.
This day, ever sacred, at turn of the year tide,
A cork‚ with the pitch well encrusted, removed is 10
From jar set aside for imbibing the smoke fumes,

When Tullus was Consul.
Take you, Ο Maecenas, of cups of your friend thus
In safety, an hundred, whilst wakeful lamp’s glow may
Continue till daylight. Away far, let be, too, 15

All noise and clamor!

ODE 2. XVII.
(To Maserius On his Recovery froman Illness.)
My spirit, why crush with complainingS, since never
The gods, or myself, would it please that the first thus
Ι Departing, MaecenaS, thou couldst be;
My glory, aud saleguard, in all things!
Alas, then, the half-ofmysoul, how, it snatch’d hence 5
By Fates’ sudden stroke, might e’er tarry its remnant,
Not equally dear, nor completely
Survivingl Such day would with duplicate
Ruin o'erwhelm us! Nay, here no perfidious
·Sacrament make I-we go then, ay go then, 10
Whenever thou leadest, and thus our last

Journey shall take, as companions prepared may.
