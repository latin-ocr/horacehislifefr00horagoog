ΟυΕ ι. V. (to Pyrrha.)*

What slender youth, alooi, where dew-star'd roses shed·

Their perfumed balm within thy grott0, woos thee hence,
Ο Pyrrha, oi the golden-'braided head, Ι
And studied innocence?

Alas, how oft, lost taith ; the frown of changing gods,

shall he deplore, when his erst placid, favoring sea,
May, whilst he wantons dreamingly, and nodS,
Darkened with tempests be!

Thy dress, he, witless, holds all gold'en in emprise,

Nor heeds the brooding storm, nor idle hope gives o’er‚
That all the wondrous love-lights oi thine eyes
Are his-for evermore.

Thus haplesS, wh0, untried, believe thy worth. But lo!

My votive tablet on yon temple-wall shines fair—
To ocean’s god, wh0, trom wreck'd overthrow,
Saves mortals, here and there.

ODE 1. XXXVIII. (Το1ιίεὸεῐνειηῖ.)1

Look you l my Boy, Ι hate the Persian doingS,
Nor chaplets bound with linden-rind adore.

So, for the late-blown rose, thy vain pursuings,
Thou may’st give o’er.

To simplest myrtles nothing add I order—
For these naught unbecome thyseli and me,

Thon serving, whilst within the vine-shade's border,
I tippling be.
