ODE 2. vt*

(To Septimius-Rural Aspirations‚ and Preier·
ences. The Repose ol Age. Final·Demands
ol Friendship).

Septimius, with me full ready to venture

'Po Gades, or 'midst our rude, unyoked Cantabrians3

To barbarous SyrteS, where waves Mauritanian
Forever are seething:

My pray’r is that Tibur-by Argives erst founded—

A seat and repose in old age may afford me

When wearied, of wand’rings o’er lands and o'er oceans3
And turmoil of warfare.

Yet still, should the Fates this unhindly refuse me,

Ι seek then the stream oi Galaesus-aye dear to 10

¹ The fleece-guarded sheep-and the fields where once govern’d
Laconian Phalanthus.

For there, of all othere, the nook is that charms me,

And where may the honey with that of Hymettus

Stand contest: whose olives may vie those in flavor
Of verdant Venafrum3

Where Spring gently lingere, and mildest of Winters

Jove ever vouchsafes too, and Aulon, aye friendly

To BacchuS, the fecund, may e’en the Falernran·
Grapes leave unenvied.

Lo, this is the place, and the fair, happy heights that

Invite ue, and'where thou’lt bedew with a tear then,

The still glowing ashes of him that a poet,
And ever thy friend wast

*Prior to Maecenas' timely, and ever cordially-appreciated gift of the Sabine F arm, the poet
seems to have had modest country quarters at Tibur. or Tivoli,as it is now called. lt is ol
this region and of his preference therefor, with Tarentum, the home of Septimius, as an
alternative choice-that he writes to his friend in the charming Sapphics and pensive strains of
the ode here dimly suggested. ln point of fact, and with the usual contrariety of human
aspirations, Horace failed to attain old age, and was presently more engressed with his Sabine
environment. Then, too¹ he was buried on the qumline in Rome, near Maecenas, instead
of at Tarentum.

This, and the eleven poems or extracts which next follow, have been selected as, in one way
or another, dealing with the country, and the rural features merely. c0n00¹¹¹⁵¹¹ss whichour
poet was so largely interested.
