He that is pure in his life, and from wiekedness
Free, will ne’er javelins Moorish, nor bows need,

For, look you, a wolf, in the woods of Sabina—
Whilst I ot my Lalage sang, and my borders · 10
O’erstray'd‚ thus from troubles beguiled-fled before me

deed, the delicate cadences os these and like passages,whether as regards their words ormetre,
that makean adequare reproduction of the shorter Horatian poems impossible to modern
tongues and forms. Such, lor example, is tinther illustration be desired, as the following
dainty blending of liquid-music and word-picture (from Ode 1. ΧΠ).
