Swift Faunus will change for Lycaeus, from heat thus .
To guard—in the fiercest of summer, and eke from

The winds, and the chill of the showers—my she-goats,

That freely, throughout the sate groves of arbutus 5
And thyme, may they quest, whilst astray, for

Ἴ The odorous males of their matings.

Nor dread then, the lunking green addens, nor haply,

Haedilian wolves of great Mars, do my kids in the pastures

Replete and benignam, as likewise ungrudging,

All honors of rural life off'ring, from horn of her bounty: x

And thou, in my valley remote, may'st the Dog·Star

Of heat thus avoid. ⁴* * * * ⁴*
