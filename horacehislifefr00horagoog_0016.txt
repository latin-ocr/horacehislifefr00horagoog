prose versione, whatever risk there may be of 6 certain
mechanioal effect, or of occasional obscurity, hasbeen
frankly accepted. Especially as this latter feature, the
obscurity, namely, is equally to be found in the work of
both commentatore and prose translatore -notwithstand-
ing au ample freedom of textual arrangement which the
latter enJ‘oy—and, for its correction involves a dangerous,
as well as presumptuous, assumption of authority.

Drawbacks of the kind last here referred to inevitably
attend metaphrastic renderings of the classic structuras,
but nevertheless such renderings would seem to be most
consistent with loyalty to the author, or, at worst, the better
choico between necessary evils. The more so if the work
of the translator is carried out in a consistently faithful
and aelf-effacing spirit3 with due rejection of his ever-

60661 gloss, or a palimpsest.

Such treatment, aside from any shortcomings of
its present experimental application, would seem to be
reasonably workahle with the longer poema—what Horace
styled his sermoni propiore, or nearer prose than verse-
however doubtful its sufficiency where the more compaot
and dainty exhibitione of his art are concerned.

But, in any case, it should afford assistance to hagionem,
and to those who seek a revival of half-forgotten acquaint-

as reproductioos these or any translations must neces·
sarily be. In point of fact, the lack of materiales this
sort to assist my own beginnings or further wanderings
in classical poetic literature, together with an increasing
impatience over the fantastic inadequacy of the accepted ¹
rhyming translations, may account for and perhaps ex·
cuse the work here found. A work which has none the
less been an agreeable diversion in the course of some·
what active professional occupations, and chiefly possible
during the comparative leisure of “a chance of travel'' of
recent years in remote regions.

The present collection and printing of my efforts isin
the nature of a ballea d’essai3 for better scrutiny, and as 6
