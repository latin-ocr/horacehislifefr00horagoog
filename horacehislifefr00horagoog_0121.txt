Perchance, too, the cypress
You draw, but what good, if a swimmer, sans hope, from a 20
shipwreck
Afloat-and whose money is paid-be the aim 01 the painting?

A wine-jar is started,

Why then, with the turn of the wheel‚ does it end a small
pitcher?

In a word, be your subject what will, make it uniform, simple.

For most 01 us poets-you‚ Father, or Sons 01 you, worthy-

Or, fearful 01 storms, crawls the ground in his questing for

Aemilius’ School, near, some sculptor the nails 01 the fingers

Will show, and alike the soft hairs seek to render, in brasses‚

Yet hapless his task thus in sum, 100 how e’er to complete it,

He'll know not. This man, were I craving a work to create
now, 35

I’d no sooner be, than to live with a nose that is crooked,

'Pho’ gazed at 100 having black eyes, and the blackest 01 hair
too.

Go choose then a subject, ye writers, to suit which you’re
equal, ’
Long turning in thought what your strength may decline, or

conversely,
