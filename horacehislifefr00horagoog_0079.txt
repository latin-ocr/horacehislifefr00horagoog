Midst gods of the highest I’ll mingle; cool grottoeS, 30

And Nymphs in their delicate choirs with the Satyrs,

Alooi hold me iar from the common, when neither the pipesof

Euterpe withdrawn be, nor yet Polyhymnia’s

Sweet Lesbian harp may disdain my rejoicings.

Ah! name me but once in the ranks oi the Lyrical Poets, 35

And the high stars Ι strik'e‚ with a proud‚ andan uplifted
forehead!

ODE 1. ΙΙ. (To AUGUSTUS Casia.)

Now full-enough on earth, of snow, and direst
Hail, hath thus the Father sent3 and with a flaming
Right hand hurl’d his darts against our sacred towers:
'Phe City irightened‚
And appall’d the nation, lest return the grievous
Age of Pyrrha, with strange monsters groaning‚
. When Proteus led his herds alost and shoreward,
'Po visit mountains;
When fishy tribes amid high elms then cluster’d‚
Where well-known haunts of doves had been before,
And eke o’erwhelmed‚ in timid ssight aswimming,
Midst waters hinds were.
seen, have we, yellow Tiber backward turn'd‚ from
Shores Etruscan hurtled‚ whilst his anger'd billows
Rush to prostrate the monuments of kings e’en‚ 15
And Vesta’s Temple-
'Phat Illia thus, her too prolonged bewailing‚
His vengeful boasts might soothe-and winding leftward,
O’erwhelm his banks, though Jove approved not
The uxorious River. 20
