* *η N ay, not to detain you with more tedious detail 82

Than what quite enough is, behold our sleek citizen changed
to a iarmer,

Oi furrows and vineyards aye prating ; preparing with vigor
his clm trees

But presently‚ pining with careS, and grown aged with desire 85
of gain, ton.

Then‚ soon as his sheep are all stolen, his she goats removed
by distemper‚

His crop given lie to his hopings-his ox, alas, slain by hard
plow·work-

Full worn and chagrined by his losses, he saddles his horse
of a midnight,

And, furiouS, rides to the mansion oi Philip. * *

* t ⁴* a “ Ah, Patron‚” there eries he,92

But Wretched thou’dst call me, if using my true name!
Wherefore I beseech, nay,

Conjure thee; invoking thy genius; thy right hand3 the gods
oi thy household,

That home to my old life, and shop, thou'lt restore me !” * *
