Your birthdays still gratefully reckon; your friends all for· 210
giving,

And milder, and better, become with approach of old age thus?

What profits it then, if you weed hut one thorn out from
many? ’

Who knows not his life how to live must make way for the
wiser:

You've played long enough in the game‚ and have eaten, and

dranktoo— ²15
Till time for retiring‚ lest quaffing here further than fit is,
A seemlier age may with laughter from revels eject you.

ODE 2. vll*

(To Pompeius Varus. A Friendly-Welcome: The Lost
Shield: Rest, after Strile.)

O thou, with me oft-times to lowest of fortunes
Reduced-as when Brutus in war was our leader-
What now, hath restored thee; a Roman,
To Gods and Italian airs of thy country:
Thee, Pompey: the first of my friendship's companionS, 5
That often my loitering days with the wine cup
Hath shar’d3 flower crown’d—ay‚ resplendent
In ointment of Syria our locks, too?
With thee, sad Philippi, and swiftest of flight, once
I suffer’d—to leave there, not shameless, my shield-sswhen 10
Destroy'd was our valor; our menacing
Soldiers e’en smiting foul earth with their faces.
But me, through the foemen, lo, Mercury swiftly
Convey'd in my trembling, with dense mist encircled:
You, back into strife-in the suck of
The war-tides, o'erwhelm’d by their fury.
Here, promises pay unto Jove now, in feastings3

¹*The incident ol the shield in Ode n, Vll, perhaps need not be taken with entire seriousuess.
Iniustice to the poet it should beremembercd that he had previously campaigned with Brutus »
and Cassius in Greece, Asia, etc„ and must have shown bravery and capacity to have been
made a military Tribune at the age of twenty-two.' Seenote, p. 202.
