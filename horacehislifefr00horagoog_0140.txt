That things which are public, from private, discerned be;
profane ones, from sacred;

All commerce promiscuous restrained too, and rights alike
settled ior marriage,

With cities planned out; having laws plainly carv’d on wood

400 and

Their verses, accrue. 'Twas thereaiter, that Homer ren'owned,
with

Tyrtaeus, men's souls to heroic and martial achievements
incited

By poems, and given in verses were likewise the oracles'

Thus life was then shown what its path is; King's favors as
well, too,
Essayed by Pierian strains; and the games also founded, that
405 hence might
Long labors of daytimes be ended.
This, say I, lest shamed you
Might be of the Muse's skilled lyre, or of Singer Apollo!

Yet, whether t'is Nature makes poems worth praising, or Art
now, ·

Is questioned: nor see Ι what study, without a rich natural
vein, or
Rude genius alone may avail, for, most truly, so much does
410 theone from
ι The other need help, and so closely their friendships conspire
’ too. ·

He who strives in a race, to attain goals long wished-for
now mark you, ’

Has much done and suffered in youth, and eke sweated and
shivered;
