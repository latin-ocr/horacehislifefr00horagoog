Having already had the hardihood thus to suggest a
certain novelty for the present treatment, Ι may perhaps
venture so much further as to hint that this, under more
practiced hande, would seem to offer a readier and more
convenient approach to the original models than that
afforded hythe rhyming-method. It certainly appears to
bo more direct, for euch purpose, than the customary
prose versione, even where the latter are of the literal or
interlinear variety.

Whether or not thie is the fact may, oi course, readily
be ascertained hy sucha comparison and matching of
tex-ts ae Ι have already invited, but that the probabilities
lie in thie direction will plainly appear when either
the distortion oi rhyming necessities, or the dislocations
of structure, necessarilyexieting in the other methods,
are considered.

What the difficulty ie as to rhyme, we have already
eeen. With the prose versione, quite aeide from the absence
oi a metrical form, there is always a. rearranging‚ or
straightening out of the text, in order to overcome the in-
versione commonly permitted or required in verse, or with
the artificial language or poetry3 perhaps, alec, an effort
to modernize the Latin idiom and inflectione.

And it was, iu fact, --as I have before indicated-pre-
cisely because of these confueing drawbacks and diffi-
culties in the conventional methodo oi translation, coupled
with an impossibility oi elsewhere finding relies or assist-
ance for my own preliminary study of the structures in
combination with the text of the originale, that the
present plan was devised and worked out to its existing,
limited extent.

A final word, now as to the extracts which have been -
made in effort to piece out the foregoing Life and to
convey a fairly adequate, if somewhat impressionistic,
glirnpse of the poet; his character, experiences‚ and per·
sonal aspect.

In this respect it will no doubt be obvious that, even
aside from intentional restriction, and limitatione of space,
the task of adequate and appropriate selection isa diffi-
