O'ertaken‚ the mule’s sent to graze, altho’ hitched to a stone,
by

Our lazy Bargee, who himself stretches snoring supinely.

When eomes then, the daylight‚ and nothing advanced is the
boat, thus 20

We see, one amongst ηε, hot-headed, ashore leaps, and torth-
with ¹

Both Bargee and mule, on the loins and head, betrims
smartly

With clubs from the willows

At last, by the fourth-honr scarce lauded,

Our taces and hands then we lave in thy Fountain‚ Feronia!

And, breakfasting, three miles creep upward, and on, till we
enter ²5

Where-built on her far-gleaming rock-piles, and shining-
lies Anxur.

For here was arriving Maecenas, and also most worthy
Cocceius; despatch'd as were both, on affairs oi the greatest-

Thus Le gates: accustomed their differing friends to compose
too.

And here, I my wretched bleared eyes in a soothing‚ black
’ ointmeut, 30
Must smear next-
But meanwhile Maecenas arrives: with him, also,
Cocceius, and Fonteius Capito—ever a man this
Ad unguem due-finished, and Antony's friend, as none other

Next Fundi (Aufidius Lusc0, its praeterr) most gladly

We quittcd, in glee at that lunaticscribe, and his trappings 335

Praetexta, forsooth! with wide purple-and panfull of char·
eoal!

Till, wearied, awhile in Mamurra’s own city we tarry3

Murena our shelter, and Capito kitcheu providing.
