between the sordid travel circumstances here related, and
what should have attended men of the rank thus con-
cerned, under the usual conditione oi their time and
environment. In this regam, Baron Walckenaer ad-
vanced a suggestion that the recent civil wars had here
disorganized the transport and relay service oi the state,
but the point is perhaps more effectively-or at least
picturesquely—made by Μ. damn, to whom we may
again appropriately give heed: “ De tout ce recit, moitie
serieux‚ moitie grotesque, vous tirerez comme nous
cette conclusion, qu’il est en effet tres-etonnant qu'un

her daily bath en route32⁶ and Cicera again, that the
outfit oi the ieather-headed P. Vedius was quite too un-
