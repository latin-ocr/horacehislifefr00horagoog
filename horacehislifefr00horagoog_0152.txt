fusion of ligurinae, vasee, silke, perfumes and precious
ornaments, not to mention couches, baths, dice-tables‚
books, and a fastidiens cuisine) the leading Romans were
closely followed by all others who could afford to imitate
them, as, likewise, that the luxury and display ot Rome

- generally, were at high water mark at this very period,

may be readily gleaned from the entertaining pagos of the
learned Friedlaender. ²²

So much lor the luxury of this epoch, and the travel-
ameliorations that Horace and his friends would doubtless
have enjoyed on the present occasion, but, probably for
good and sufficient reason, dispensed with, under a re-
straint which—like his reticence over the burning ques-
· tions of the time-we may never find specifically ex-
plained. And yet, even in the absence of such explana-
tion, one may reasonably surmise what the essential
reason must have been. Indeed‚ it is odd enough, that, ct

· all of the forty or more commentatore, from the Scholiasts

down t0 those of the present time, whose works have been
examined for the purposes of this paper, none have ad-
vanced an hypothesis in this regard which seems at once
most simple-and obvious, as well as here fully war-
ranted.

This, oi course, is that Maecenas and his party were
thus purposely voyaging under studiously unobtrusive cir-
cumstances-in such manner, indeed, that it not reason-
ably likely to pass wholly incognito, with euch an exalted
personnel, and on such a frequented highway, there still
might be a measurable freedom from sensational reinark,
and in any case, if need be a better scope ior subsequent
triph official disuuowol. That confidential errands of the
sort must have been common enough, during these in-
triguing times, is as obvious as that, in the nature of
things, they would seldom be recorded, or their reconde
preserved. We find, however, Cicero's mention of Bal-
bus, the younger, directly on the point: his “secret mrs-
sioo‚’' namely, “to the Oonsul Lentulus, irom Caesar,
with a letter, a message, and a promise of a province.''²⁸
