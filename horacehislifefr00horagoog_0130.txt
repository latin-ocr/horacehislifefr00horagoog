In old days, the flute÷n0t as now, bound in brass, and of

trumpets
A rival, but simple, and slender‚ and furnished with few
stops,
When breathed as accompanying aid to the chorus, was use-
iul, as also
205 For seats, that were yet not too crowded, to fill with its sum·
mons, .
Where list’ners-iew being the people—were easily num-
bered:
And frugal, and chaste, and full modest as well, might
assemble.
But, after the nation began all its bounds to make wider, as
victor;
Its cities more amply in walls to surround‚ and with wine-
⁰111),
210 Its Genius to court—eke in festivals daily; unbridled-
- There came ior our mensures oi verse, and for musical
tones, greater license ;
Since what could unlearn‘d, or iree’d-laborers know of such
matters3

The clown being mixed with the cit, and the base-born, as
well, with the honored?

To arts that were ancient, both gesture and dress were then
added,

And flute players dragged on the stage with them vestures

215 more flaunting:

As well, for the lyre's grave tone new notation was fig-
ured,

And eloquence took on alike now, a manner both headlong
and novel,

As useiul to things and sagacious: divining the future,

By oracles not greatly differing in Tone from the Delphis! “
