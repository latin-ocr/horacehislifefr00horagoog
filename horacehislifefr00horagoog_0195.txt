like Byron’s f‘Hintsss' and Pope's “Imitations ”, an aspect
not here under consideration-their renderings are found
to prove both useless and misleading, when looked to tor
assistance in serious study ot the models, or in pursuit of
faithful translation*

The essential objection, in work of this character, to
artists and poets of their kind, is, that they pose as trans-
latore, rather than paraphrasts, and one may observe with
curicus interest the internal evidence of sensitiveness on
this head to be found in many ol their introductory ex·
planations orprefaces. For, indeed, it is but too painfully
apparent that much of their product, which has thus tar
gained currency when pinned to the broad and suffi-
cient, however defenoeless, backs ol the giants of classic·
literature, would have fallen flat it issued with the in·
dividualism of an “ imitation '’, or even of a paraphrase.

On the question of sufficiency as poems ol original
effert, some ottho work ol various of these writers-such
for example as Francis, Conington, Martin, de Vere, Ra-
vensworth, and Gladstone-is of great interest and charm3
as also ot surprising ingenuity, considering the handi-
oap of a certain amount of regard for originale, and the
“restraint of rhyme'’. But, alas, of the imitatore ol
lesser flight, it may be said, in the words of Martin’s
paraphrase of the Ars Poetica,

“ ³* ⁴* ⁴* most ol ηε, by the pretence
Dear friends are duped of seeming excellence.'’†

As for the great free-handed Dryden, some ot his per·
formances3 notably, the famous rendering of the Fortuna
Ode (3, XXIX), are even better than their original models
