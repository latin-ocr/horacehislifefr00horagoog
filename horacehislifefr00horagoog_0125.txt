Aside threw their paint-pots, and all the big-syllabled words
of their phrases,
If anxious the hearts of spectators to touch, with lamentings.

Not sufficient itis that your poems have beauty: of charm too,
They rnust be, to carry off with them soul of the list’ner— 100
For, truly, with laughter to laugh, and to wail with the
weeping,

Must ever the countenance human.

You wish then my tears, mourn
Yourself, at beginning: for thus will your miseries touch me,
Telephus or Peleus: and if you ill-speak your assignrnentS,

· l’ll slumber‚ or smile.

And the accents of pathos best suit with 105
The visage in sorrow3 of anger, alike with the threatening;
The sportive with wauton: the grave with expressions aus·
terest. ,
Hence, Nature first inwardly forms us to note, and to follow
All changes of fortune. She prompts, or impels us, to
wrath, or
To earth casts us down, with the wcight of our grief and

affliction, 110 ,

And afterwards pours forth our souis with the tongue to
interpret.

If unfitting words thus are found in the lot of a speaker,

Both knights and plebeians of Rome will uplift you their
laughter.

One varies next, greatly, if gods or if heroes be speaking3

A ripencd old-man, or a lad who’s aflush with youth's fervor; 115
The dameof importance3 some nurse of abustling demeanor3

A wandering merchant; the tiller of fields that are verdant;

The Colchian‚ or Theban, tho' bred in Assyria, or Argos.

Hence, follow tradition, or things self-consistcnt thus feign,

If a writer.
