hearth·fire piled with seasoned wood against her weary hus-
band's homeward coming ; his herd in wattled-lold now saie,
enclosed, whilst fully milked is, too, their swollen udder's
store; the season's wine cask of its sweets eke tapped; an
unbought feast arrayed?

Not me could Lucrine oysters charm e‘er better—nay
nor turbot, ay, or sear, should thund'ring storm o'er eastern
waves in winter’s tempests drive these to our sea: not even
Airic's bird may to my stomach‘s depths descend—nor yet
Ionic wood-cock-thus more happily‚ than gatherings from
the richer branches that the olive tree affords, or meadow-
loving surreie, with the mallow, best ior ailing bodies fit, or
lambkin slain for' feast of Terminus, or hid, snatch'ed from
the wolfs' pursuit.

Amid such feasts how pleased is he to see the pastured
sheep then hastening home, to watch the tired oxen trail,
with languid necks, an upturned plow: the home-born slaves

-proofs of a rustic opulence—about the shining house-gods
grouped l

When thus proclaimed, the usurer Alfius, already here
almost become a countryman, his loans then fully gathered
in, at Ides—but, sought were fresh ones, at the Kalends, still.

This renowued poem presente more thau the usual obstacles lor metrical translation, and in
fact seems never to have been thus rendered with satisfactory result, or without grem liberty and
departure. These abnormal difficulties arise no less from the peculiarity oi the epodic structure
which Horace here, and ior a while, experimentally adopted-with its shorter‚ alternate echo
conplete-than trom the inordinately long paragraphs, and strophes, indicated by the accepted
ι arrangement and punctuation ol the chiei authorities, as in verser 1-8, 9-22, 29-36, 39-60, etc,
Nor, indeed, are the considerable cumulatioris ol illustration and alternative, thus presented, oi
tractable nature. But, aside from these drawbacks, and the somewhat unreasonable assign.
ment ol poetic sentiment oi this refined aud idyllic charam to an Alfius, the poem is charming,
as well as valuable, in its pictores oi ancient country liie; and the irony ot the end alike most
entertaiuing. lt is hoped that the present faithful translation may yield some adequate reflection
ol these leatures: but at least our poet’s characteristic return upon his ffightot enthusiasm, and
the world-old, yet still appropriate, sermon-lessou oi the termination should thus be sufficientiy
apparent.
