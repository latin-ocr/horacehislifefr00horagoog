from the brewity oi the alternate verse oi the couplet (aa oi an echo of
the longer, next preceding one) and are classified in period of compo-
sition with the less-finished Satires. Both Satires and Epodes thus
appear to have been published between B. O. 35 and 30—when Horace
was in the period of his ammoni propiora, orpoems “ nearer prose thau
verse ”-and the three first books oi the Odes to have followed about
B. (t. 27, with the Epistles coming somewhat irregularly thereafter.
The Carmen Saeculum, a sort oi poetlaureate-composition, at Imperial
command, is readily assigned to B. c.17,* and, as will be seen, the
Ars Poetica is by some authorities deemed to have been the latest, as
wellas an unfinished work, perhaps first published after the author’s
death. This latter poem indeed ia often classified as the third oi the
Epistles oi the second book, although apparently without sufficient
grounds for certainty in such definition. On the general subject of
Horace, and the evolution of his poetical produnt, Dean, Wickham
finds it “characteristic oi the man that his Satires should mellow and
humaniue into the Epistles, and that the Epodes should drop so early
their iuussznni ἶδέα, and solten and generalize into the Odes. The
process in both cases is nearly complete before the name oi the com·
position is changed.''

lt will be observed that the Eaeyi Monumentum Ode (3. XXX)—
here used by way oi introduction-appears at the end oi the third
book of Odes, and, in its terms‚ indicates a completed work or finished
group oi poema. This latter collection is appropriately preceded by
au introductory dedication to Maecenas who by this time-fortunately
for the world at large, as well as ior our poet—had assured tothe latter,
by the giit oi the Sabine Farm and otherwise, an ease of circumstance
compatible with leisurely and finished productiori.
