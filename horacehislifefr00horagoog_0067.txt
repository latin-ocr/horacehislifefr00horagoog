ODE 2. XIV.

(To Postumus)

Ah, how they fly now, Postumus, Postumus-

' Our on-gliding year-times! No piety hinders

The furrows and grasp of old age, or
May tend off implacable Death e’er!
Nay, not if with three hundred bulls‚ in each day's lapse,
Ο friend, thou may'st ask the appeasing of tearless
Dread Pluto, that ever a thrice monst’rous
Geryon, and Tityos, holds bound, near
The sad stream t'is certain we mortals alike—though
We linger awhile here, sustained by Earth’s bounty- 10
Must cross, e'en if sit we in king's seats.
Or hinds of the field are, when summon'd.

’ Ay, vainly the bloodshed of wars we seek guard from,

Or rough, broken waves of the hoarse Adriatie;

And eke too, in Autumn, the ills for

Our bodies, oi menaeing south winds ἔ
Soon visit must we the black river that slowly
By Cocytus wanders, and vile brood of DanauS,

Condemned there to labor, forever,

With Sisyphus, son of Aeolus
Thou leavest thy lands here, and home, and thy pleasing
Fair helpmate ε nor aught of the trees aye thus foster'd,

Save only the drear, hateiul cypress,

May follow their master scant-tenur’d Ξ
ConsumeS, then, an heir, who is haply more worthy,
Thy wines by an hundred heys guarded, and stains thus

Thy floors with a vintage more noble,

Than hail’d is, at feasts of the Pontiffs.
