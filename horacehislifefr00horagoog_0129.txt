Spectators present to themselves. Yet, however, one must
not

Parade on the stage what’s unfit there: nay, much must be
taken

From view, that full soon, with good taste, may be told to those
present.

Medea, her sons, ne'er let slaughter, in face of the public, 185

Nor openly cook human entrails, indeed, the detested Atreus ;

And make not a bird out of Procne, or change to a snake
either, Cadmus-

Whatever you show to me thus, unbelieving, I'll loathe it.

Ne’er less than five acts, nor yet, mark you, be spun out be-
yond this
Your play, should you want it approved, and, once seen, soon

repeated: 190
Or gods interject, save where plots worth their weighty ex-
pounding
Shall happen: nor yet may fourth-persons make ventures in
speaking.

Your chorus, the parts of the actors3 their duty as men, too,

Must foster3 nor anything sing e’er, moreover, between acts,

That mayn't what’s intended full aptlyconduce or adhere to— 195

The good aye thus fav’ring‚ whilst giving advice to the
friendly: Α

The angered, restraining, to cherish those dreading the
siniul:

Must eke praise the meals of a table that’s frugal, as also the
fairness-

Of justice and lawS, and of peace whereot gates are held
open;

All secrets entrusted, be keeping; to gods make due prayers,
and beseech that, 200

For misery, fortune return, and that pride, in its stead, be
forsakeu.
