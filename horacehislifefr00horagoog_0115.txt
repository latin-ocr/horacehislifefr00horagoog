His Own Origin, Appearance, etc.)

Vertumnus and Janus, my Book, you still wistfully gaze at:

Forsooth, to be sent forth, with Sosian pumice due-polished!

My keys too, you hate; ay, all seals that are liked by the
modest,

And, shown hut to few, you lament, whilst the public shops
praising,

Though never thus nurtured: Be off, then, where pining to
sink to!

Yet ne’er you'll return, once thus publish’d-“Poor wretch
what have I done?’'

“What meant I”? You'll say there3 when critics have stung,

when you find you're Ι
Some narrow space squeezed in; your lovers all cloyed, and

sated.
Nay, still (if, through hate of your iolly, the augur may
rave not)
Caressed you will be here in Rome till your bloom has
departed, 10
” But when once bethumbed by the hands of the vulgar, and
dirtied,
'Phen haply, in silence, the lazy moth’s food you become, nay
⁵ Or Utica flit to; be bundled away to Ilerda!
Then laugh must your monitor, now disregarded, as he who
His obstinate ass from the edge oi the rocks once pushed

over
When angered; for who can e'er labor to save the unwilling? 15

the times is in the little story, and anyone may stroll today along the Sacred street, past the
Basilica and the sharp turn that leads to the block os old houses where the Court Honse stood
between St. Adrian's and San Lorenzo in Miranda. Anyone may see iust how it happened,
and may know how Horace felt when the Bore buttonholed him at the corner ol the Julian
Basilica till his final deliverance near the corner of the Triumphal Road, which is now the vta di
San Gregoria.”

The late Mr. Sellar, in his ¹‘ Horace and the Elegaic Poets.” prononnoed this Satire to be the
‘¹ happiest specimen os Horace’s dramatic manner‚” and added that “ lt brings a scene os real
life before ns with the vividness oi Catullus and even with finer irony.''
