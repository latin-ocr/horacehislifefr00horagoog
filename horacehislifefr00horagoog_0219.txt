(To Licinius; Auream i ³* ἥ mediocritatem, εἰῶ)

More rightly thou'lt live, Ο Licinius, ii neither
High-seas always seeking, nor menacing tempests
O'er cautiously feared are3 pursuing too closely
A treacherous shore-line.
Full golden the mean, mediocre, then: whoe'er 5
Attains it, so saiened, rechs nought ot the ruin
Oi squalor in hovel, nor risk has from envy-
Thus sobered—in mansions.
'Tis oftenest the winds are tormenting the lottier
Pines too, whilst ever, with height, comes worst wreckage, ιο
In tall oi the towers: aud strikes aye at summitS,
The lightning, in mountains.
Nay, hope, amidst hardships—whilst hearing, in fortune,
The changing oi lot-should a heart that iorearm'd is:
And though the rude winters are called back upon us 15
Through Jupiter, lee still
Removes them. E'en evils that now are, hereaiter
Will be not. Ay, sometimes the music, when silent,
Is waked in his cithero-nor always his bow kept
Astretch-by Apollo. 20
When fortunes are narrow, courageous-and likewise
Enduring-appear then, and wisely, moreover,
Contract aye, in gales that too happily favor,
Thy full-ewelling canvas !

*This perhaps the most distinct illustration ol Homee's characteristic philosophy ol the
aurea medeberitas, is thus reserved ior the conclusion oi the biographical matter here rendered.
Althongh oi general application, the Ode appears to have been evoked hy speciei need oi
warning to a friend, the restless and ill-laced Licinius Murena. Like many megs, it vens
unheeded. Murena, while heading ior a more open see, in time ol politiml stom, end
neglecting to shorten sall, speedily ermined shipwreck; in other words. was suspected oi eon·
spiraey, ior ambitiosis personal ains, and, efter a trial, presently executed.
