Exegi monumentum mm perennius.
(Carm. 3. XXX.)

SONNET.

Look thee, kind Flaccus-genia] Cynic-Sage3
Tribune, and Poet3 Courtier, Friend, and Wit-
Here are some Old World verses thou hest writ,
In dim translation, on this modern page!

Thy Monument endures! No North-wind's rege,
Nor Rain-drifts herm, though crowding Cycles flit,
But Pontiff: ay, Proud Capitol-with it,

Thy Vestal, too-are dust, this many an age.

Nor burgeons now, thy Fame, as dream't ot yore,
From Grecian forms, of Latium’s verse made part,
Yet still, thy Genius lowly·b0rn could soar

Above Rome’s ruin—to a New World’s heart.

And here, to-day, far from Ofanto’s (*) roar,

We, Horace, hail thy Delphic·laurel’d Art!

* 'ste modern name os the Aufidus River.
