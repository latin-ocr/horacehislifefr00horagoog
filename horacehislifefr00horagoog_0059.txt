Onn Ι. V. (To Pvuunn.)

What slender young stn'pling, amidst many roses,
Be-pertum’d with odorous liquids‚ pursues thee,
O Pyrrha3 in grotto delightful,
For whom thy fair tresses entwin’d are
With art ot the simplest? Alas‚ how oft saith, and
Mutations ot gods-when his erstwhile calm ocean
Is roughened by blackest of storm winds-

who, credulous‚ precious as gold now enjoys thee,
And aye free and faithful believes, in his hope, too;
Ignoring thus ever the tempests
Deceitful. Ah. wretched are those who
Untried hold thee fair! Lo, my own votive tablet
The sacred-wall shows, with my still-dripping off’ring
Suspended beneath it to him that is potent-
My robes-to the Sea-god!

But vainly, of gales and of forests3
When leaves, all aflicker-at breath ot Spring’s advent 5
Thus shaken—and emerald lizards, if haply‚
The boscage they stir, e’er prolong in
Her heart and her kneeS‚ both, a tremor.
Yet ne'er as a cruel, fierce tiger-nor anger'd
Gaetulian lion-to rond, I pursue thee:
Nay‚ cease thus thy mother to haunt, and,
Full-n'pen'd, a husband now eling to 1
