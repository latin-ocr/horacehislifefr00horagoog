Maecenas, of grandsires full kingly, the issue,

O guardian and dearest·held pride of my glory3

There are, who in chariots the dust of Olympios

If seen is a hind by his hounds that are faithful,

Or torn by the Marsian boar, are the fine nets in tangle.

For me; lo, with ivy-twined crowns of the learned,
