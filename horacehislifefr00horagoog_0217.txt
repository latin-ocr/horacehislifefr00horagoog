sermoni propiora features: an idea suggested by the
structure of Dr. Brice's recent ‘⁸ Poems of Horace,’' and
his effert to produce, in a prose form, what he speaks of
as “a rhythmical cadence in the clauses and sentences’'
But with this difference however, that whereas much of
the work oi that eminent translator appears, at least pri-

marily, to have acquired its aspect oi “asort of blank verse
in individual lines,” through ‘⁸ inadvertence,” the present
result, so far as the extract from Satire 2. VI, is con-
cerned, is arrived at by purposely turning into prose what
was previously a carefully constructed metrical imitation.
In this manner the verses-beginning with a broken one
of nine words-are simply run together without other
alteration of structure than is necessarily involved in such
prose form, andin dropping the capitals which are com-
monly seen at the beginning oi lines in metrical arrange-
ments. In the case of the Epode version, however, there
was no previous metrical arrangement.
