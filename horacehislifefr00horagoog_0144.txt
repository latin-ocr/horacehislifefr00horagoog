For, surely, if once the Pit tried thus, and pulled from, n’eer
would he

A man be, again, and iorego for a death so renowned his
devotion.

Nor shows it, sufficiently, why any verses he makes, nay, nor
470 whether,
Defiled his dead father’s own ashes has he, or the lightning's
sad markings
Removed with an impious hand-tho’ assuredly raving, as
bears might
In caves, when obstructed, with will to break down and
escape through the gratings:
And learn’d, and unlearn’d, put to ssight-this reciter,
unsparing!
475 But whoeverhe grabs, he holds fast to ; and slays, with
tenacious declaimingS,
Unquitting of skin till he’s gorged, as with blood, like the
leeches

Mr. Saintsbury remarks oi the ioregoing poem, and oi the effect of Horace as critic, ‘⁴ the
few hundred lines ⁸ ⁸ ⁸ are positively ‘made ol quotations.' Every man os letters, at
least, ought to have learnt it by heart in the original during his youth. ⁸ ⁸ ⁸ lt is not rosh
to say, although, perhaps one must have read more literatures and passed through more phanes
oi literary judgrnent than one, before sayin it with conviction—that thereisno school or period .
os literary practice in which the precepts od Horace, when rightly taken, have lost, or are ever

lssrely to lose, critical vitality. ⁸ ⁸ ⁸ To those who consider criticism as a whole and his-
torically, the enormous influence which the Ars poetica has exerersed must always give it the
rerogative place among its author’s critical work. ⁸ ⁸ ⁸ '' (History of Criticism and
