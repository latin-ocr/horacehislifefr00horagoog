“Quinctilian's criticism upon the Odes can scarcely be
improved ⁴* * ⁴* In this airy and playful grace, in happy
epithets, in variety of imagery, and exquisite felicity of ex-
pression, the Odes are still unsurpassed among the writings
of any period or language. * * * they possess in perfec-
tion the power of painting an image or expressing a thought
in the fewest and fittest words, combined with a melody of
cadence always delightful ⁴* ⁴* ³* Their beauty of expres-
sion is indeed apt to blind the reader, upon occasion, to the
povertylof idea and essentially prosaic turn of many of the
odes. Strip them of their dress, indeed, and their charm van-
ishes ⁴* ⁴* ³* His power of passion is limited and his
strokes of pathos are few and slight ⁴* ⁴* ⁴* Rarely do we
lose sight of the poet in these Odes * ⁴* * the charm of
the majority of them, especially those which are devoted to
his friends, or which breathe the delight which the contact
with the ever fresh beauties of natural scenery inspired him.”
“The difficulties of such a task ” (i. e., of the translator) “are
endless. ‘It is impossible,’ says Shelley, himself one of the
most successful of translators, ‘to represent in another lan·
guage the melody of the versificati0n3 even the volatile
strength and delicacy of the ideas escape in the crucible of
translation, and the reader is surprised to find a caput
mortuum) This is true even in the case of languages which
bear an affinity to our own, but especially true where Greek
or Latin is concerned. No competent translator will satisfy
himself, still less can he expect to satisfy others *It will
always be easy for the critic to demonstrate that Horace is
untranslatable ⁴* ⁴* ⁴* Still what has been will be. The
attempt, often made, will as often be renewed. Dulce peri·
culum est. The very difficulty of the task makes it attractive.

Lovers of the Venusian hard will go on from time to time
striving to infuse the charm of his manner into English

measures. ⁴* ⁴* * -Maurln
