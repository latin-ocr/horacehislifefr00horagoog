According to wish, still, my own would content me, Those

Witglglffiils and Seats of the State Ι ne’er take for myseli,

but
A fool stay, in eyes of the vulgar-if not so in yours-for
Reiusing such burdens: though wholly unused to their bother,
Since forthwith a greater estate must then surely be pur-

chas’d3 100
More folk be saluted: whilst one or more always be taken
As company, so that abroad, or in country, alone ne'er
I'd venture; a lot more of servants, and horses alike, be
Maintained—and with chariots to get too!

Whereas now, Ι freely,

With cropp'd mule, can go where Ilike3 To Tarentum may-

hap; though 105
My wallet both beast and the rider may gall with its burden.

Moreover, none charge me with stain, as they do you, my
Tullius,

When Tiburtine-way you, a Praetor, with five of your f l-
lowing

Servants, and kitchen‚ may travel, conveying wine hampers!

And I, in my comfort, exceed you, proud Senator, truly, 110

With thousands oi others, so living.

Ι go then, as likes me,
Alone thus: Ι ask what’s the price of the herbs; what of
barley;
The cheats of the circus stroll past, in the dusk of the twilight
And oft, in the Forum, awhile watch DivinerS, and home then,
To onions and pulse, and to pancakes, as chiefest of dishes
Of supper that's served by three lads, where a slah of white
marble
Two cups and a bowl holds in place, and an ewer affords too,
Of coarse sort3 with bottle and beaker of ware of Campania.
