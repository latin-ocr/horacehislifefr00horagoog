ODE 3. XXX.

(To MELPOMENE: The Poet's Estimate oi his own Career,
and oi his Fame: his Monument, etc.)

Here finish’d a Monument, have Ι, than brass more enduring
And e’en regal works oi the pyramids, higher,

'Phat ne’er wasting rains, nor yet Aquilo's bluster,

May haply demolish! Nay, whether unnumbered

The years be, in series, and flight of the seasons!

Not I to die wholly, ior of me shall much still

Escape Libitina, and aye, with the new generations

Be crescent in praises airesh, whilst the Capitol

Climbed is by Vestal, in silence, with Pontiff.

Of me shall they sing, where of Aufidus loud roar the rapids 10
And where, by scant streamlets, once Daunus o'er rustics

Had kingdom: For I, from the low-born, am potent,

As first an AEolian verse, for the Latins’

Own measures, transporting. Assume thou the pride then,
Well earned by thy merits, and thuS, with the Delphian- 15
Laurel, full freely, Melpomene, circle my temples!
