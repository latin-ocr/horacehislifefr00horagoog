The comparative scantiness of the works of Horace
which is here remarked has often enough been regretted
by others than the Emperor. Yet this was perhaps a
natural consequence oi the pensive, indolent, and reflective
tendencies which the poet so often discloses: of tempera-
mental characteristica, in short, intensified by uncertain
health, and possibly hy the after-fatigue oi somewhat un-
bridled pleasure secking in earlier life.

From having once been what he called-in Ode 4. II,
v. v. 28-32—“a Matinian hee, cathering with toil the
pleasing thyme. and making verses with humble wit,
around the woods and banks of Tibur ”‚ we find him later
concluding—as in Epistle 2. II, to Florus-that it is
“better to rest than to scribble my verses.”

But that Horace still, and at all times had scope
and taste for diligent pursuit oi the works oi others,
there are various evidences. Perhaps the summary of
his views on the reading of books and ci their effect,
whether ior solace or support, which appears in Epistle
1. I,—albeit there apparently somewhat limited to certain
philosophic maxims—may suffice for illustration of the
point: “ Your heart is burning with the fires of cupidity;
tormented with some other passion: yet there are
sovereign charms, and words oi potency which will cure
your ills, or at least appease them. You are puffed-up
with the pursuit of vain glory: there are still open to you
healthful practices: there isa certain work of which the
reading, three times repeated, will purity your seul.
Envy, anger, idleness, love of wine, and of debauchery,
there is indeed no passion so savage but that it can be
soitened, it only one shows oneseli docile to such culture.'’*

We have seen-in the Epistle to Lollius—that our Poet
asked for “good books in lull plenty,'’ and otherwise
