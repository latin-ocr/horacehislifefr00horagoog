FROM 0333 3. XXIX*

* ii * * * {e *
Fortuna, her cruel employment is pleased with:
At playing her insolent game aye resolved on;
Transferring her honours uncertain,

Now to me, now another, benignant.

I respect her when constant: at stir of her

Swift wings, I yield all she gave, and within my .
Own virtue enwrapped, to an honest
And dowerless poverty turn in my courtship.

FRow Ona 4. IX.
'k ³1⁸ * ³1⁸ {r {r {r ’k
Not in possessing largely, can’st thou 0311 him,
Thus truly happy: of better right he taketh
The name of Happy, that the gods’ fair
Bounty doth most wisely hold in use:
Who knoweth poverty‚ and to endure it,
And e’er disgrace far more than death may dread:
Nor eke, at dear friends' need-or whether
For country's call—to perish hath a sear.

FROM ODE 3. XXIX.

* * * Lord of himself, is he,
And happiest bideth, who 's free at day's end,
To say, ‘I have liv’d! With to-morrow’s sombrest
Shadows 311 the heavens Jove may cover, Ι
Or sunshine purest, yet ne'er cancel
= Whate'er the past holds: nay, nor haply
Unde, transform, or leave annihilated,
What once the flying honr hath borne away.
