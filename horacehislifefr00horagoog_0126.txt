120 Perchance you would bring back the honor’d Achilles?
Then strenuous; wrathful, he must be; alike unforgiving and
fierce too;
Denying that laws are for him, or that aught is, but what his
arms yield him.
Medea, make cruel, unbending3 and weeping be Ino;
Ixion perfidiouS, as lo, a vagrant—and sad too, Orestes,

If what to the stage is still new, you may venture, and dare
125 thus >

A character novel to form, be your care to preserve it

As started, and aye with itseli, to the end, full consistent.

A difficult task t’ls, to properly treat what's but common,
And better you'd render the verse of the Trojans in acts
than .
To launch into subjects unknown, and untouehed, on begin-
130 n1ng.

Atheme‚ the most public, becomes your own matter of right, if
its trifiing and wide-open round you abstain from delay in,
Nor word for word rend'rings your care is to make, as the
faithful
interpreter might: nor, again, throw yourself like a mimic,
in straits, whence
To draw back your toot you by shame, or the laws of your
135 work, are forbidden.
Nor may you begin, like the writers oi Cycles, of old, with
“The Fortunas of Priam 1 sing, and the Glories of Warfare,'’
For what ,that is worthy may vaunting like this e’er produce
you?
The mountain in labour-a mouse, its ridiculous issue !
140 How better for him then, who nothing inept is attempting:
Thus, “Sing me,O Muse! of the man, and the time after
Troy was captive,
Who customs and cities oi men, tull a-many, had view of.''
