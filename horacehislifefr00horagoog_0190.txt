It may be remarked, while on this poem, that few of

the translatore seem to treat it with the consideration
which its obvious dignity and dramatic force, and almost
unique position among the author’s writings, as a bit of
stirring present action, would seem to demand. Francia
for example apparently constrained to find a rhyme with
“flama‘', followed the above enquiry (addressed tested,
concerning his love) with the comment “ Is shetheDamel'’

“ The sons of circumcision may receive
The wondrous tale, which I shall ne'er believe.”

while others, following him, readily adopted the new point:
of which, by the way, there is no bint in the original
text. The Rev'd. Dr. Howes even improved it, by
