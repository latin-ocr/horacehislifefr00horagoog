point; ΜΓ. Simcox⁹ asserting that “ Horace and his friends
seem to see no more by the way than other travelers’',
and that “ his hints at the importance ol the Maecenas
Mission give the zest ol incongruity to the petty discom-
forts of his suite.'' Dean Wickham, the latest and most
minute—as well as authoritative-of the British com-
mentators‚1⁰finds room for only the curicusly myopic
view (which appears however, to have originated with
Orelli11l, that ‘⁶ a chief purpose '' ol Horace’s account is
“doubtless tc give a picture of the poet’s relations to
Maecenas, the freedom and absence oi servility which
characterized them: the literary circle in which they were
shared‚ the absence, even at a critical moment, ol any

On the other hand Ritter12 comes nearer the mark.

Hindorf, as quoted, however, with disagreement by,
Orelli (cited supro) concludes that the Satira was not
intended for publication, or otherwise than as a “ couvenir
of the trip ’³ tor Horace’s intimate friends.

Kirchner,¹³ ton, decides that the “interesting events ’⁹

amusement ot his fellow trevellers''

From these cautious, and apparently inadequate conclu-
sions of the Britons and Germane, one turns with relies to

mentatore. There may thus be found, in M. J aniu’s some·
what impressionist conception ¹⁴ what would seem to be
greater force and discernment‚ whether or not this might
have been due, in his particular case, to a sympathctic in-
stinct ot race and language kinship, rather than to the
scholarly critical capacity for which so many of his coun-
trymen have been distinguished in this and other fields
From him we learn that the Satire is “ une piece de vers
