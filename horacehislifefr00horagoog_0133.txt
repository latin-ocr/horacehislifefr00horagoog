shameful.

By no means may all who see unbalanced poems, thus judge
them:

And Romans have granted indulgence, unworthy their poets:

That witness my faults will aye leave me quite safe‚ and en-

Secure hope of pardon? In brief, I’ve avoided blame, not
Made earning of praises.

sallies, 270

Acclaimed far too patiently ; whether the one or the other,

And foolishly(tho' Imayn’t say it) admired these, if truly may

by the wine-lees,

And, following him, an inventor of masks, and of robes too,
more seemly- ’

In short, t’was Aeschylus, he, both low stages of beams first
constructed,

And taught the sublime to be spoken 3 how also to strut with
the buskin.

Succeeded Old Comedy‚ next, then 3 and not without ample

Of p1·aise,but soon lapsing to vice, from its license-to
violence even,
