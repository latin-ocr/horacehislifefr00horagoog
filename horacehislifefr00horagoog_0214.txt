also enjoyed the advantage 01 0 final, ii hasty, reading-
over, in part by my friend Captain W. (1011101Μο0010,
and in whole by my kinsman Wilson Miles Oary, Esq,
in effert to detect such superficial errore as are inevitable
in compositiones this character. The greater learning,
experience and taste 01 these gentlemen, however, had 110
scope or responsibility for more material changes or
correctione.

As only the very simplest, most direct, and faithful
phrase and word renderings were here uniformly sought
to be availed oi, no material help could be had from the
rhymed versione.

That the new treatment thus resulting may be useful
1ο my fellow beginners, or to those who desire a reminder
of former contact with the originals here concerned—and
perhaps serve 1ο 010010 a new and agreeable interest for
some few others-is all that is expected 01 it. For the

Other useiui publicatione—among the 111011 01 valuable works 01 like general
character-are 10111111 in “The Poems 01 Horace. ALiteral Transiation, by Hamilton
Bryce, LL.D.,'' eta, London, George Bell iic Sons, 1897, and the recent conveniently

But 101 more extended and exhaustive analysis, the admirable work 01 the late 111.

As might, perhaps a priori, be expected, the more sympathetic, and theretore
more readilyunderstandabie, commentarios are encountered among the writings 01

And, 01 such commentarios, the scholarly treatise hythe late Baron Walckenaer
