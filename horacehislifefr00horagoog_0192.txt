Before leaving Lord Raveusworth, it should be re·

marked that 116 put the above mentioned Ode 1. XXVII;
61 which we have already noted Poreon'e mutilation, into
six-line, instead 61 four-verse stanzos, witha consequent
expansion 61 twelve additional verece3 plue sundry inci·
dental liberties with the text, and, finally, in 1116 famous
Ode 1. XXXVIII, (“Persicoe odi,’' etc.) left out 1116
6666111161 point of the drinking beneath the vine.

The late Professor Conington, another J'uetly iamed
translator, was not 611611 iar aetray‚ even under the com-
pulsion 61 rhyme, notwithstanding hie curione declaration
that he felt at liberty to aim 61 epigram and pungency
where there was nothing 61 the kind to be found in 1116
original text. But 66111661 his work shows 1116 usual varia-
tione and inversione 611116 school. Thus, in his rendering
61 the “ Oarmen Saeculare ’', “ silvarumque potens Diana '',
diminishoe to ‘¹ huntress fair ”3 “Oondito mitis placidusque
telo e r r Apollo”, 16 “Olay thy shaft,Ap0110,by'’,
and “ per ardentem eine fraude Trojam castus Aeneas'',
expande to “ 1111111166, and piles 6161616, Aeneas destined,
pure beart ” etc. Again, with thie gentleman's rendering,
we have, in Ode 1. ΙΙ, our above mentioned charming God-
dese somewhat disfigured ae “ Venus, laughter-loving
dame'' 161 6 rhyme with “ 16166 ” and, in Ode 2. ΙΙΙ, the
fine “in aeternum exilium impositura cumbae '’ 61 the
1661 two verses, expanded and explained by “force him,
hopeless 61 return, on board the exile-ehip 61 1616”; this
latter, by way 61 accommodating 1116 1166116 61 “um’', and
“hate’', in 1116 next preceding verses. 111 Ode 2. VH,
Brutus is explained tous as having “ warred in Greece ’²
and the Maseic wine, as ‘⁶ Lethe’s true draught ’', although
neither 61 these assertione, however correct, 16 16 be
discerned in the original statement 61 Η61666. In the
Professor's version 61 tho famous Ode 2. XIV, (“Eheu
fugaces, Postume ’' dcc.) the classic two-line stanna 611116
conclusion 16 somewhat quaintly weakened 6616116116,

“ Α1111 richer spilth the pavement stain
Then e'er 61 pontiffs' supper 1611”.
