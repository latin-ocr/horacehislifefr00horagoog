attractive‚ and generally read-even 11 effectively repro·
duced in modern tongues-or whether they must share

’ the obscuration of other extended and more modern

poetic efforts.

Ooncerning this general subject Andrew Lang has re-
00011)τ observed, what is indeed obvious enough, that loup-
poema are now-a-days quite out 01 1000ος Poe,whom Swin-
burne calls “that exquisite critic‚’' having earlier denied
that any such ever existed. Howeverthe 10010 may be,
and whether or not a somewhat hurrying modern environ-
menthae progressed beyond ataste 100 such protracted
entertainment, it 10 01000 that our classical models 01 this
nature must be taken as they are, 11 01 011, and whether
longor short. Iu any case, however, it would seem fair
to suppose that neither student nor pleasure reader 01 10-
day, in the midst 01 000 manifold and bewildering offer-
ings and demands, will want, 00 perhaps tolerate, any
unnecessary expansion 01 the classic models, whether under
the whimsical exaction 01 rhyming methods, or to gratify
the harnacle-like creators 01 0010000000 ornaments there-

for. There may be a cognate question, as well, as to
whether poetry, like the sister-art 01 music, is not now ,
engaged in some process 0100100οΙ evolution from the
00001010110001 venerabis conventional 00111010111100, but

here is an open door which leads too far afield for discus-
sion 10 the present limited space.

In venturing to assert a novelty 100 the method 01
Horace-translation herewith presented, Iam quite aware
01, and familiar with, the labors 01 Newman, Sewell,
Aruold (the German) Lytton‚ and Hovenden‚—not to
speak 01 the Miltonian fragment, presently to be referred

, to-as well as those 01 various minor workers in the field 01

non-rhyming, metrical Horatian renderiugs. And so 100,
with the like performance 01 the handful 01 000 co·laborers
in other modern tongues. Afterall, the field 10 question is
sufficiently small and its occupante lew enough to admit
01 ready investigation, whatever the language or locality
concerned‚ even 11 such enquiry be widened‚ and embraces
the larger spheres 01 general classical translation.
