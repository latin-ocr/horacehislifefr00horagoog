Worth righting by law, which, enacted, disclosed us the chorus
Thus shamefully stilled; having cancelled its right of de-
faming.

N aught thus was unaimed at, you see, by our poets nor
285 truly,

Least worthy of honor were these, in that foot-prints of Gre-

cians

They dared to forsake, and for matters domestic sing praised

And, whether in dress of praetexta or toga, thus teach us.

Nor yet by its valor, and sheen ot its arms, more potentini,

T han ever by language, would Latium be, ii not hored, one
290 and all,

Were these poets with tedium of file-work, and patience.

O you, from Pompilius descended, reject pray‚ all verses that
neither

Long days, and much scratching oi pens, fail to better, nor
harh, Α

By ten times the chast'ning oi finger-nail-test, are unmeasured !

Is native born genius more blest then, than Art, with its
²95 mis’ries?
N ay, truly, who think so, and, likewise‚ that Helicon bars out
sane poets Α
(Democritus's notion) are chiefly of trimming their nafis and
Their beards‚ much neglectfu13 aloof hid, in nooks‚ from the
baths too ;

For he great esteem may acquire now ; as well as the N ame
ot a Poet‚
Whose poll is past curing by three Anticyras, and never
300 To Barber-Lycinus commits it.

. Aias how unlucky!
I’m purged thus oi bile, with the yerdure and hours of the
Springtime‚
