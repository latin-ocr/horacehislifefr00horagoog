Finally, in Ode 3. XXX, Melpomene is requested to
“put glory on'’,·in order to rhyme with “non'’ in the
next line.

Of Sir Theodore Martin, and his graceful, and other·
wise generally faithful work, there is little need for ad-
verse comment, outside of his egregious expansion: We
have seen his somewhat belittling treatment, of Ode 1.
XXVII, but one more illustration of it, in the case of the
same poem, may be of use as showing the emasculatIon of
rhyme requirements: ThuS, the stirring commands of the
speaker in that instance, when worked out of the hopper,
appear in the following Tupperian style a Ι ³*

“ Friends your places resume,
And let us have order once more in the room.”

Nor should it be fcrgotten that this is all that the trans-
latorgets outof such fine original grist, as a a ὕ “im.
pium lenite clamorem, sodales ’'. Gladstone, here, was not

greatly better, with his “Have done, Ipray, a a Ι
and on your elbows rest. my boys ’', to match “ noise ’'.
Again‚ under Sir Theodorels hands, the impressive
“Moriture Delli ” (of Ode 2. III) expande and attenuatos
to “ For Dellius thou must die, become a clod of earth,”
thanks to an exigency in respect of the desired rhyme for

“ mirth '', while the reference to the brook, in the twelfth .

verse oi the same poem, takes on the extraneous or purely
cumulative matter (to fit with “tune'’) of “Still mur-
muring as it nune, to the hush’d ear of noon.’'' As an-
other example of this gentleman’s expansion-in addi-
tion to those already above specified-it may be noted
that his Ode 3. Ι(ί ‘ Odi profanum ’', etc.) swelle from forty-
eight, to eighty-three verses, and theone concerning For-
tuna (or Ode 3. XXIX) from sixty-four, to ninety-six3 the
latter version also contaIniug, as a concrete example of
gratuitous iniection, the following-after verse 52 of the
original:
* * * * “bids him rise,
And in mere wantonness of wlnm
Her favor shifts from me to him.’'
