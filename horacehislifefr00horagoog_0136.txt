Το Greeks, was a genius granted; a style full rotund t00,
By aid of the Muse, for pure speaking, tho’ more they of
pra1se avarrcrous.

325 Our Roman youth, practicing long, thus, a pound’s weight,
now, mark you,
To split into parts of an hundred, are learning. “ Ι say, there!
Ο Son of Albinius: if Ι from five ounces, remove one,
Pray,what then islett?’' Hecould answer‚“,why,f011r.” I,“Aha!
You are able to guard your affairs.'' “ But, first add one,
what happens ?”
“ Why, half the coined As'' With such mind-rust, and
33ο hank'ring for moneys,
Thus tainting their souls, can we hope then for verses made
worthy
Of rubbing with ointment of cedar3 of keep in our smooth,
cypress boxes?

Aye willing to profit; alike give delight, are the poets—
What's pleasant and useful for life thus supply, in their
teachings

335 Whatever your precepts, be brief3 saying all things concisely,
That minds which are docile may see, andis faithful, retain
them:
For vain superfluities flow from a breast that too full is.

Let fictions, for pleasure designed, ever nearest to truth be,
Nor whate'er it wills to propose, should your play claim
belief for,
Like Lamia's dinner-a live child-drawn forth from her
340 stomach.

Centurian-Seniors will grumble at what may be lacking of
precept:

In turn ton, all poems austere, are unrelished by Rhamnian-
Knighthood.
