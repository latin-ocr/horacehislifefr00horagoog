however disposed to recognize the doctrine of autre temps,
autres mucore, as appropriate for a latter-day judgment.
For thus, indeed, one needs to blink and swallow some-
what, before now either accepting the amiably established
convention of ignoring such features, or, iu spite of them,
according to our ancient poet the supremely compli-
mentary modern term which is the last mentioned of
those so applied in my prefaoe.

It will be seen from the selectione that, in Pyrrha,
itis sought to introduce at least one prominent mem-
ber of the group of Horatian-charmers; the yellow-
haired young person, to wit, whose famous “simplex
munditiis '' has been at once the despair and attraction

would, after all, seem to be that it was aschool-boy’s task3
a suggestion iu support of which there is here some evi-
