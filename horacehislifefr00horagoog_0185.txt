POSTSCRIPT.

The foregoing extracta should sufficiently illustrate
the theory and conclusione ol the leading critics and au·
thorities in respect ol classica] translation methods, and
indicate as well the views ol those who are opposed to the
practice of the rhyming school.

What the chief exponente of the latter have to say,
may readily be found in the prefaces usually accompany-
ing their works‚ and therefore need not here be particu-
larized. In brief, however, this is commonlya plea ior
Lord Ravensworth's “greces of rhyme''‚ or, in other
words, an ornamentation which the Russian‚ Pheta, as-
serts to be needed “as hythe arrow‚ its feathers ’² to assist
the ssight of “translated song.''

Otherwise the claims or excuses range from Professor
Conington’s modest, but corf* suggestion as to “ rhyme
being an inferior artist’s only chance of giving pleasure '',
and Sir Stephen de Vere’s insisteuce concerning “poems”
——together with his approval of Hallam's stricturas on
“servile translation ''‚ and of Boileau's odd notion of
“ jouster contre l’original ”-down to the amusingly iranlr
confession of Mickle, in the Lusiad version. The latter
poet, indeed, is worth quoting: “it was n0t”, he re·
marks, “the ambition ot the translator '' in this case, “to
gratify the dull few whose greatest pleasure in reading a
translation is to see what the author exactly says: it was
to give a poem in the English language.”

Here one discovers the underlying obtrusive personal
element ot the rhynring translator—whether it be called
an ambition or avanity-coupled witha characteristic
obscurationes the defenceless original author whose work
is supposed to be presented: his “abandonment '' as old

*So characterized because ot a necessary implicatlon that the Translator vus here
consider-ing his own contributum rather than that ot hls author.
