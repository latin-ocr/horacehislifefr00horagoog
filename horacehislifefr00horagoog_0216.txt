ADDENDA.

It has seemed, on closing the proofs of the foregoing
material, and as an afterthought, that no attempt at illus-
tration of the Horatian philosophy can be considered
reasonably complete without an exposition oi the poldon
mean doctrine, ol Ode 2, X. Alsa that the features of
the poet’s relation to Maecenas, and the life and ways of
the Rome of their day, should equally be supplemented by

such light as may be found in sundry further extracts
from Satire 2. VI, than those already sought to be repro·
duced. Perhaps, too, a suggestion of the charming
ing country soenes, and of the amusing as well as in-
structive irony of Epode 2, should likewise be supplied.

Hence the following additions and the irregular order
in which they thus appear. The note to the Ode suffi-
ciently explains the genesis and bearing of the latter: as
to the extracts the original Satira is of importance, aside
from other obvious values and interests, in affording oom-
mentators a point oi departure for reckoning its date, and
that ol the beginning of the Maecenas friendship. Dean
Wickham properly remarks of this poem that: “It
should be compared especially with Sat. 1, VI, as com-
pleting the picture there given ol Horace’s mode ol spend-
ing a day in Rome, and with Epist. 1. 14, and the
beginning of 16, for the description of his country life
andei tho Sabine farm in which much of it was spent.'’
The Epode rendering explains itseli‚ while the two further
additions, viz. the rhymed attempts at Ode 1. V, and
Ode 1, XXXVIII, may be exoused hy my desire to have
the same thus grouped with these final experiments.
They are early ventures in Horatian metrical translation,
made some few years ago when deferring to the conven-
tione οἰ rhyming precedent.

In the present prose versions an opportunity is availed
of for thus further experimenting with certain ol the
