to determine hy light application thereto oi the nail-tips
Furthen it is a somewhat curicus fact that, owing to the
peculiar texture oi the local milletones‚ Swinburne, a
modern traveler‚ finds the bread ot Canusium still ol gritty
composition. Barium, the Bari of present timeo, remains
as fishy as of yore, hut, unhappily ior some of us later,
competing Christiane, the Apella oi nowadays no longer
connotes a confiding simplicity.

We have seen that Gibbon (who, however, hasbeen
described as destitute ot the “ enthusiasm of humanity ”l
failed to see much in Horace's hemely narrative. That
he did so fail, and as well that his was douhtless the pre-
vailing point-of-view of his time, marks effectively how
far we of to-day, avid as we are of just such simple
human revelatione, have dritted from the older standands.

To us, the “drum and trumpet'’ style3 the “ celebra-
tion oi the imposing events oi history with congenial
pomp of description,'’ like the “ampullas et sesquepedalia
verba,'’ of which Horace speaks, no longer hlock the way
oi unadorned simplicity and human realism, where these
appeal for sympathetic hearing.

But the old canons of “taeta'’ and “elegance,” and
“ art '³ (like the notions oi rhymed translation) die slowly.
Nor is it, perhaps, to be expected that alooi workers
among the arid materiale ot the academie closet will
stop to consider picturasque possibilities.³³ Yet even
these gentlemen, and our truly great historian too, would
doubtless have awakened to some warmer glow of appre-
ciation had Horace but substituted for his sorry Messius

and Sarmentus etuti—as, alas, he might have done, but ·

⁴ did not-an equal number of lines conceruing his and
Vergil’s freehand private conversation.

One might halfway guess what this may have been,
or, better, frame its semblanoe with apt quotations from
the heap so freely afforded by their respective works,
however much, in fact, the real thing must now, unhap·
pily, romain another and an untold story.³4
