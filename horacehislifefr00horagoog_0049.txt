And, weary of combat‚ let worn limbs thus haply
Be stretch'd 'neath this laurel ot mine, nor
Yet spare thou the casks for thee destined, 20
Whilst with the oblivious Massic our polish'd
Fair tankards are brimming. N ay, pour out capacious
Sea-shells of rich pertumes! Whom, now, the
Fresh chaplets to weave ot the parsely
And myrtle may hasten? Whom Venus here name too, 25
As master ol revels? Nor shall I be saner,
Carousing, than Bacchanalst—Greeting my
Friend it delights me the madman thus playing!
