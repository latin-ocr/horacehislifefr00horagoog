Then to sleep Ι proceed‚ ne'er uneasy lest for me the morrow

Means early to rise, and to wait on the Statue of Marsyas, 120

(Who claims he can’t suffer the sight of the youngest of
Novians)

Thus rest Ι, till fourth-honr, and after that, wanden or
reading

And writing what pleases me-lone thus-am duly annointed

, With 0il of olives (not such as foul Natta robs lamps of)

Or wearied-andif by the fiercer-grown suns-mys, to bathing ¹25

Admonished-I quit the Mars' Field, and my game of the
hand-bell,

And next, after dining-not grossly, but just t0 fend off any

weakness
Of stomach, the day through—indulge in home duties.

Lo, this is
Alifefor one freed from all wretched ambitions! 1, mark you,

Console myseli thus, living happier far than ii Quaestors 130 ,

My father and grandfather-uncle, to boot-had been, ever.

Both home, and Apulian nurse, then astray from,
And weary of play3 whilst in slumbers
Of childhood-with fresh-leaveS, the wood-doves
Of fable enveloped‚ to wonder of dwellers
In nests-Acherontian lofty, and those of
The forests oi Bantia3 of fields, too,
In fertile ‘and lowly Forentum :
That there, from foul vipers, and bears, in full safety
I slept, and was crowned with the green, sacred myrtle
