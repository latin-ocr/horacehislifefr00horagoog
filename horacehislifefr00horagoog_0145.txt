THE FAIVlOUS JOURNEY OF HORACE.¹

(Reprinted, by permission, from the Second Yam-Book
of the Bibliophile Society, of Boston: with complete
Recasting ol the accompanying Translation.)

Ten well-known fifth Satire, of the first book of Qum-
tus Horatius Flaccus, deals with the poet's interesting
J'ourney to Brundusium in the exceedingly choice' com-
pany ol Maecenas Vergil, ct ulii, and is commonly held
to have concerned some of the weightier matters of State,
during an intensely dramatic periodos Roman History.

An analysis ol the story thus narrated,—ot which
a fairly literal English rendering, in accord with the
latest expert translation, is here appended lor convenient
reference—with notes-thereon of findings and conclu-
sione by various translatore and commentators, should
prove of interest. All the more eo, perhaps, since the
learned writers thus concerned, even when enjoying the
cumulatius advantages of continued historical criticism,
generally fail to accord a due importance to the narra-
tive. As a matter ol fact, but few of them seem to
have caught its deeper interest and probable meaning, or
to have thought it worth while to bestow more than a
touch and go ol passing remark upon these features of the
rough-hewn, cameo bit of treasure-trove thus preserved
in its quaint, Old World Setting.

Such an analysis3 after the fashion of a lawyer’s brief '
oi fact, or laW, or precedent, necessarily rests upon the
reports and learning of others, without pretence ol new
discovery or special scholarship. It may therefore find
excuse or tolerence, even in a field which, like this, is so
largely preempted by special studente.
