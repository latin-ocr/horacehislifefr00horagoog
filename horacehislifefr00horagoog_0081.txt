They’ll hear that citizens have whetted keen the sword's-
edge,
' Which the fell Persians best should perish by-

. of combats too—our youths, whom parents’ vices

Have left scant-number'd.

What god invoke‚ may people‚ 'midst a sinking 25

Empire’s fortunes3 with what prayers, petition too,

, May Virgins Sacred, when thus scarce attending
Their hymns be Vesta?

Whom now assign, for sins, an expiation,

May Jove e’en? Yet, that thou wilt come, we pray thee- 30

'Phe mists still clinging round thy shining shouldere—
Augur Apollo!

Or, an thou wilt, Erycina, e'er smiling3

Whorn Joys encrrcle, winging aye the Loves with,

But, thy neglected raca, thine own descendente,
Regard‚ Ο Founder.

Alas! too· long thou’rt satiate of war’s sportings,

Whom clash delightS, where gleam the polish’d helms afar,

Of savage Moorish infantry, amidst their bleeding,
stem-visaged foemen.

Yet, if thou changest; would'st of youth take figure,

Pray corne to earth as if the winged son, then,

Of Maia-gentle, and thus deign that we may hail thee
Caesar's Avenger:

Latethus to Heav’n be thy return, and, haply,

May’st thou be pleas’d to linger with Quirinus’ people‚

Nor-of our impious deedS, perchance grown weary—
Let e’er the swift gales

Uplift thee far. Nay, rather ltere great triumphs gather3

Here, Father love best to be called, and Prince too;

Nor suffer Medes to ride amongst ue, unavenged3
Oleader, Caesar!
