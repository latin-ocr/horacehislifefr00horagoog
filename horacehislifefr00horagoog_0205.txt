It is of course urged in Horace’s behalf that the
ladies of his poems are largely fictitious, and likewise
presented with the higher lights and touches of the poetic
imagination, but, newertheless imaginings aud senti-
ments of the kind can hardly here be reconciled with the
attributes of good breeding, or even of humanity, as
now-a-days understood. For, in any case, it would ap-
pear from the leading authorities, that there was an
ample flesh and blood realism in sundry of these instances,
albeit with artistic embroidery, and with masking of
names.l

It is in this fashion that Cinara—the poet’s early and
most real love, whose untimely demise he so much de·
plored—has been supposed (by Professor Newman‚ among
others) to be the Neaera of the charming Epode XV.
Aeto Cinara, however, we unfortunately otherwise know
but little: nothing beyond what may be gethered from a
few references, (as in 4, I, and XIII) and yet, even in her
case, our poet did not hesitate to uttera post mortem slur,
when, long afterwards, he spoke of her, in the Epistle to
the Steward (1, XIV) as “ grasping.’'

With thIs aspect of Horace, or of his writings, includ-
ing another side which fortunately need not here be
discussed‚ † one necessarily becomes somewhat impatient,

* 'l'he mellifluous charm of the feminine appellatione of Horace's selection has
already been referred to. The quality ot these names, indeed, is such that they will
hear repetItion even when detached from their respective poetic-settings, thus: Pyrrha,
Leuconoe, Lydia, Glycera, Tyndaris, Lalage, Chloe, Megiila, Pholoe, Myrtale, Damalis,
Phyllis, chloris, Barlne, Asterie, Lyce, Neobule, Rhode, Phidyle, Galatea, Lyde, cns,
Cinara, Oanldia, and Neaera.

'l'he uninltlate, confronting this list,wlll pleaseobserve thatIts eflnals eracem-
monly, and perhaps more effectively, maced—rather than omitted, or slurred-and
this with somewhat of a vanishlng “eh'' suggestion, instead of the “e'’ ot “need‘'
So, too, there is a predilectlon in favor oi sounding the “a’' where lt occurs-and
especlally n tn termination-rather like the one in “father '' than that in “fate ”r raet

as the “ae'' or “ey ¹' which some ot us seemto fancy in the finlsh of lra, (iuba, Utica,
Lima, semime, and the like.

fVoitalre's epistle to the author will doubtiess be recalled:
‘⁶ J 'entends ta Lalage ie vols son doux sourlre-

Jen'oseteperlerdedonhigurinum’
