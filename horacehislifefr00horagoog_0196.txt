in certain respects, however lawless from the point of ’

view of reproductions.

Browning, already partially quoted, will bear further
hearing on this general subJ'ect, although dealing with
an author and model that differ from those here more
immediately concerned. Referring to his rendering of
the Agamemnon of Aeschylus, he adds that he would be
tolerant, in the case of so famous an author, “ of even a
clumsy attempt to furnish ὕ a ³* the very turn of
each phrase in as Greek a fashion as English will bear,
while, with respect to amplificatione and embellishments
-anything rather than, with the good farmer ‘to gape
for Aeschylus, and get Theognis! ”

It will hardly be necessary for me to delay my reader
with suggestion that what we commonly obtain from the
rhyming translatore is an equivalent of Theognis, in lieu
of Horace, but one may at least point out that there is
unhappily too often the addition of an “Old Muytens ’' as
well.

The latter, alike discussed in the Browning Introduc-
tion, appears to have been a certain picture clea'ning-
artist, of Stockholm, who, wanting “ himself to have some-
thing to do with the work of whatever master of promi·
nence passed through his hands '’‚ accordingly ‘⁶ beautified
every nymph of twenty '' (in Raphael’s Racoyoitioo of
Achilles) “with a widened eye, and an enlarged mouth.''

Another clement of licence exhibitsd by rhyming
translatore—but in some degree necessarily affecting all
metrical imitatore-is discernahle in a hazardous assump-
tion that versione of the classic modele can now be made
what the originale “would have seemed '' in the author's
time, or appropriately “ modernized,'' whether in form or
substance, to fit our present environment. For notions
of this inept and mislsading character are frequently to
be found underlying the recorded failures of the past,
and, indeed, are substantially what many, if not most ’
persons, even of fairly educated teste, will commonly ex-
press, by way of off-hand opinion, concerning the proper
scope and aim of such metrioal renderings.
