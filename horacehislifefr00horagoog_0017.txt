like but more comprehensive treatment of the same ma-
terial now invited by publishers, and which may be a
possibility, amid tho chances oi the future.

Whether translations of the kind are worth doing,
ie, of course, the essential element of my present experi-
ment, but that the Horatian matter which they concern
is of ever fresh andcontinuing interest, and that any sim· 3
plification ol its use and approach is desirable, will hardly ··
