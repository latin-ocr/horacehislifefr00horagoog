· THE EPISTLE To THE PISOS
ow

THE ART OF POETRY.

———-—-

If a head which is human and neck of a horse, then, a painter‚
To join has will for; with variant plumage bespread too,
On limbs from all animals gathered, or with some unsightly‚
Swart-fish he may finish a woman3 begun with great beauty,

. Could you, when this sight shown, withhold it your laughter‚

5 my friends? Nay,

Believe me, ye Pisos‚ abook would such picture be closely
Resembling‚ if dreams like to those of a sick-man, a-J'umble‚
It offerS, or notions fantastic that ne’er head nor foot oi
To form may reduced be.

Both painters and poets‚

10 Whatever they venture, you say, have like power of trying?
We know it, indeed, and the privilege grant, and make
quest for,
But not that the gentle should mix with the savage3 that
serpents
Be mated with birds, or the tigers allied with ¹the lambkins.
Full oit, grave beginnings, too pompously promising all
things, ¹
15'Phe purple, with one or two far-gleaming bits, sh0w; in
patches
Betagged for a finish, as if thus Diana's own grove, and her
altar-

Or, mayhap, the flow thro' fair fields of meandering currents;

Rhine's river; the arch of the rainbow—are forced in descrip-
tion,

'Pho' not now in place where they should be.
