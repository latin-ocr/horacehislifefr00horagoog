the Pisos, or Ars Poetica, which, in the original, con·
taine 11011001 hundred and seventy six verses (or lines),
is stretched, when in 1110 hands 01 811 Theodore Martin, to
seven hundred and thirty eight such verses; by the famous
Doctor Francis, 10 six hundred and fifty nine, and by Doctor
Howes, to seven hundred and thirty two; the late Pro-
fessor Conington having stoppcd at only six hundred and
six, while Smart’s version almost doubled tho original
measure.

’11101 these eminent translatore indulged 10 like
liberty with others 01 1110 Ηο101100 poems, and were 101-
lowed by minor artists of their kind, goes without saying.
One need hardly'here delay 101 1110 1110010, but it 10 01
10101001 10 observo that Conington amplified theone
hundred and four verses 01 801110 Ι. V. (1110 Journey to
Brundusium) with 1011110111, Francis, with thirty four,
and Honos, with fifty eight, while Sir Theodoro, and the
Poet Oowper, followed 8010110111]010000001110101111 over
000 hundred extra lines.

And this, notwithstanding that 1110 extraneous padding
here mechanically demonstrated, 10 10 addition to what·
ever word-enlargoment there may in any case be neces-
sary, when turning the highly concrete and inflectional
Latin into English*

That a 1011 translation 01 those 001110 11001110 000 easily
and uniformly bo made in exact line-for-lino measure, I
have hereinbefore sought to demonstrato, while an exam-
ple 01 00 indisputable success 011110 kind, asto 00001 them
at least, may be found in Arnold's unrhymed, German
version 01 1110 81110110 10 the Pisos,† as also in that 01 like
character by Mr. R. M. Hovendcn.‡ And indeed. this lat·
ter work 1100 similarly been kept to its original composa,
by 1110 Russian, Pheta.

So much 1011110 011110001οο question, and 1110000011101-
