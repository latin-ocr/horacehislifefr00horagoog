With the foregoing, and with what the metrically
imitated poems and extraots should afford, it is hoped
that the many·sided Horace may fairly be disclosed in his
more individual and human aspect. That his charin can
' thus be conveyed to any appreciable degree is doubtful, and,
, in any event the spiritual, dramatis, political, historioal
and patriotic features of his writings a're largely obliterated
under the process of selection and rejection necessarily
imposed by the scope of the present work.

The intimate relations existing between Horace and
Maecenas rnay perhaps sufficiently be estimated from what
is shown in the foregoingpages2* it need only herebe added
that the bounty and kindness of the latter continued
throughout his lifetime, and culminated in the well-
known farewell exordium to the Emperor on bahali of the
poet which is recorded by Suetonius: “Horati Flacci, ut
mei, esto memor.’' (Remember Horace as you would my-
self). But this chapter of Horace’s life can hardly well be
closed without some mention of the dignity and inde-
pendence manifested in his attitude toward the sincerely
, and justly beloved patron—the friend and benefactor,
whom, as we have already seen, he loyally and speedily
followed to the tomb on the Esquiline. A few extracta
from the famous Epistle to Maecenas (1, VII) may serve
to illustrate these features and at the same time afford a
trifle more of light on our poet’s physioal condition3 his
testes and habitudes, more particularly after the passing
of youth and its vigor. ,

Translating somswhat freely from Baron Walckenaer's
version of this oft-quoted llpistle, the essential points
may thus briefly be epitomized.

“I promised you ’⁹ (begins Horace, by way of excuse,

and possibly in consequence of friendly chiding) that I “

would not stay more than five days in the country, but
