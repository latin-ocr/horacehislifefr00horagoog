stands on the theory that rhymcd versions are, generally,

either meaningless jingles, or unwarrantable departures ’

from, and inflations of, the originah that reasonably ap-
proximate metrical renderings, even if of slavish and awk-
ward adherence to the meaning and the general order of
the original text, are less repellent than mere unmeasured
prose; and finally, that no English imitation consistent
with these views is, as yet, elsewhere available.

M. Janin, it will be remembered, rightly asseris the
unusualness of the particular product of the Horatian
Muse here under consideration. Its author is said to
have characterized it, in form, at least, as “ rhyth-
mical prose ”3 while Sir Theodoro Martin‚ himself perhaps
the best of the rhyming-translators considers tho work
generally to be “ mere narrative, relieved by humorous
illustration.'' In any case, it will readily be observed
that Satire I, V, sufficiently lends itself to the present
form of close adherence‚ in English, and that, in turn,
such treatment finds additional justification in fairly
rendering the rough, and often trivial, features of its
text. Here, too, fortunately for the present purpose, is
an almost total lack of that amiable Horatian dogma3 that
half-satiris philosophizing on human and superhuman
affairs, with deft and nnexpeoted play of close-packed
idea and metre, the well-known “Horatii curiosa feli-
citas,” which ordinarily present such insuperable obstacles
to adequate metrical, and other renderings of our old
friend of the Sabine Earm. It is, in fact, the least attrac-
tive of the works of the poet, as well as one of the most
difficult to agreeably present in English metrical form.

The long, serenteen-verse interlude of the Buffoons-
which, of course, may readily be found, if desired‚ in any
of the prose translations—is here designedly omitted. This
on the theory that it is not essential to the present discus-
sion, albeit interesting, and valuable, as a picture of. men
and manners of the time. Otherwise, however well such
features may have served to awaken interest, in an envir-
onment of autre tempe, autres moeurs, they alas—like the
