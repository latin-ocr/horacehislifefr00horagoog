Ah! ThaliarchnS, t’were best to accept these ;

Leaving the rest to the gods e'er-for, once they

Appease bnt the winds that the raging old ocean 10
Now vex with their struggles, the cypress

And aged wild ashes, may rest too, unshaken.

Nay, what the tomorrow may bring thee, 'ware asking:
What days fate may grant, aye take score of

As profit. Nor yet love’s sweet follies 15
May'st spum, Boy, or shun e’er the dances,

Whilst blooming youth lingers, and gray age awaits thee
Morosely. Lo, soon, both afield and in campus,

Soft sounds, in the night-time, the whisper

Of meetings alooi at the trysting: 20
Or comes. from some nook of an ivy·cr0wn'd angle,

The laugh ol a girl who has lurked there, hali-hidden,

Till snatched from her white arm, or finger,

'Phe pledge is that's teebly defended.

Nay, ask not-since knowing were sinfnl-what for me ; for
thee, too, .
As end, Leuconoe, the gods give : nor Chaldaean tables
Consult, with the numbers. T'were best what may happen

endure then—

Ay, whether· Jove grants us more winters, or haply our last
be

The one that now wearies, 'gainst rocks e'er opposing, the 5
billows

Etruscan. Be wisel Rack thy wines off: our brief span
long hope thus

Abridges! Lo, e'en as we talk here is Time, in its envy,

Fast flying! Then quickly To-day grasp-aye heedless of
Morrows!
