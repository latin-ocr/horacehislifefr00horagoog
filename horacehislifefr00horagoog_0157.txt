But what a picture! The two young poets about to
“desipere in loco ’³ at Capua, having, it only for a frag-
ment oi that lar off daytime, escaped their duty with
le Patron.

“ Est qui nec veteris pocula Massici

Nec partem solido demere de die
Spernit . . .’'

Their compani0n‚ Varius, as it might seem, remained
to help Maecenas with his game of ball. Him we find,
later, presented with a million sesterces for the tragedy
ol “ ThyesteS,’' but he and it are now in effect lorgotten.
As to his truant matos, we know how they have iared,
for has not Horace said of himself, with perdonable pride,
and justest prophecy:

“ Non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei

Vitabit Libitinam ε usque ego postera
Oresoam laudereoens . . ‚’‘³⁶

Oi the more retiring Vergil, let another Master speak:

“ Ο degli altri poeti, onore e lume‚''³⁶

‘⁸ Virgll has been the object ot an adoration amounting almost to worship, but he
will otton be tound on the shelt, while Horace lies on the student's table, next his
hand.'’ -Oum Wmm. Honm.
