On tho question of women, and his treatment of them,
-or of their poetic simulacra-Horace cannot be said to
have left an enviable record. He seemed indeed to show
but scant mercy for those of the sex who were indiscreet
enough to lose their youth, especially if at any time
they appeared to have manifestad a possible insensibility
in his hehalf. Witness the cruel onslaught on Lyce (4,
XIII) whom he had before respectfully serenaded (3, X),
his various harsh references to Chloe, the charming
“fawn'’, once so gracefully pursued, and above all, his
brutality to the faded Lydia (of i, XXV) whom he had
erstwhile thought better of, as in the dialogus-ode above
referred te, and elsewhere. Thau, too, his ferocity con-
cerning Canidia (as in Sat. 1, VIII) is wholly inexcusa-
ble, on any grounds, even granting that she had lost her
former attractione, and, in her old age, was still no better
than she should be.

Sir Theodora Martin sought to account for this lack of
“gracious tenderness toward women”‚ on the ground

of a “want of the early influentes of a mother* or
sister.’' His J'ust criticism, and as well his apt quota-
tion, concerning the poet's attitude towards one of these
unfortunates may here be remembered: “Poor Lyce
might at least have claimed his silence, if he could not do
what Thackeray says every honest follow should de,
‘think well oi the woman he has once thought well of,

*sn- Theodore incidentally remarks in this regard that the peet's mother is nowhere
mentioned in his works. Here, however, he faiis to note her inclusion in the reference
tothe parents in Satira 1, VI, 95-96. This, although somewhat glaucing, may fairly be
taken as of moment, seeing that she fa thus bracketmd with the highly eeteemed father
in an emphatic assertion. As a matter of abstract sentiment. and hy way of finding
better general possibilities of inherited cultivation and attuned aptitudes than now
appear, it may be regretted that there is no apparent likeiihood in one of theold potions
of Horace's origin. Namely, the theory of Jean deHamel, which is quoted-withentire
disapproval—hy the Reverend Pare Sanadon, and founded upon the Pontica pinus
suinae nobilia (of Ode 1, XIV) to the effect that the father was one flavius Flaccus,
of Pontus, a distinguished officer in the forces of Mithridates, the purchased prisoner-
slave of a Quaestor of Venusia, who obiigingiy liberated him and also “lui fit epmtaer

ln point of fact a Roman slave of the period might hi many emes have had birth
beyond the common herd, bethave remained in servile condition after capture through
inability to find ransom. The slave merchants commonly followed Rome's conquerIng
armies, and in one instance alone-as may be sesnin Book 2, cnsp. mmor Caeaar's
sensuve-tepeo of the Aduatioan Geuls were purchased by them out of a single city.
