Get hence, then, to ponder alone your fine sonorous verses:

For choirs of writers must groves love, aud shun too the
citios,

In shade and repose aye rejoicing as clients of Bacchus

Would'st have me, 'midst tumultS, alike of the day and the
night-time,

Here sing, and the footsteps uncertain oi poets thus follow? 80

Nay, look you, some genius seli-choosing calm Athens for
studies ;

E'en seven long years thus devoting, and grown to old age
too

With books and vexations, comes forth like a statue in silence

Forsooth, and, when home, shakes the people with laughter3
Must I, then,

Thus deign, in the tides and in tempests of town-life, to waken 85

The soundsof a lyre attuned to the songs that are fitting?
ἃ 'k ἃ ἃ ᾖ ⁴1¹ ἃ 'k *

N ay, much will endure Iin soothing the breed of irascible-
poets

When writing myself3 even stoop for the votes of the people, 10²
But now, having finished such tasks; with my reason restored

too, .

I close infull safety-'gainst all who recite-ears once open. 105

One laughs at composers of songs if they’re feeble, but truly

Such writers are charm'd3 and, admiring themselves if by
chance you

Are silent, will happily praise whatsoever they've written.

No doubt then, t’were wisest aside to throwtrifles : the useful ,41

To study, whilst leaving all child’s-play to suitable ages,

Nor words thus pursue, to remould ior the harps of the Ro·
mans,

But rather, true numbers, and measures of life, begin learning.

Wherefore I'll commune with myself now—in silent reflection. 145
