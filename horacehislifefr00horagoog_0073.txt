Why, then, with proud gates to be envied3 with lofty 45
And novel bedeckings, should raise I a palace?

Why leave e'er, my calm Sabine Vale too,

For riches, by far more perplexing?

Me, the gods aye protect, and to gods is my piety,
Likewise my Muse‚ e’er a pleasure * * *

ODE4 ΙΙΙ. (To MELPOMENE.)

ss νε * oe νε oe ι
Lo, all this, thy bounty! Moreover, 21
That fingers of those who are passing, point to me—
Os Rome's Lyre the Minstrel, and that I
Thus breathe‚ and thus please, if I do please, is thine too.

01>ss 2. XX. (To MAECENAS.)

Ne’er common, nor feeble‚ shall beartme alost then
Of wings-thus transform’d—thro' the atmosphere liquid3

· (Α doubly·made Poet) nor tarry on Eanh, Ι,

Still longer: but, envy surmounting,

Leave cities below. And, moreover‚ tho’ humble

The blood of my parents, ne’er 1, whom you call to,
Beloved Maecenas, can perish;

By Stygian waves be encumbered.
