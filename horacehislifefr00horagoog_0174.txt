‘⁴ Poetry was once written to be sung. The Greeks, whom
the Romans afterwards imitated, sang their verses first to the
lyre, then to tune.''

“While this” ⁴* * * was habitual, the time occu-
pied by syllables was the most influential force in metre
Moreover, in the Greek and Latin tongues, the vowels are
so distributed among the consonants that the syllables with-
out difficulty can be referred to two classes, long and short’'
* ⁴* * * Since we now read and no longer sing, accent is
naturally more prominent to the ear than time, especially in
languages which have every sort of length, and not easy to
be distributed into long and short * * *.

* * * By accent, an Englishman understands a supe-
rior stress oi the voice placed on one syllable.'’ —annnu

“From no Roman critic, so far as I know, have we any

notice ot that insurrection or resurrection (whichever word
may be preferred) ol accentual against quantitative rhythm
which is one oi the most interesting and certainly one of the
most mysterious phenomena ot the literary history of the
world. ⁴* ³* ⁴* '' -Smwrsnunv

“ He ’⁹ (the translator) “should largely abridge the syllabic
length of the Latin text.’' -Gnnnsrown

“The accent, or hezghtened tone ot Vergil in reading his
own hexameters was probably far from being the same'ihing
as the accent or stress with which we read them.’'
