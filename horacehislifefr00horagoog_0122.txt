Your shoulders may fit. Him that wisely his theme has se-
40 lected,
Not style will desert3 nay, nor lucid array oi his matter.
Thus ordered, both merit and charm will be found, ii Ι err
not, ¹
Since here one may say just what things should be said, and

moreover,
Let most others go, or at least, be waived off lor the present.

This wooing, that spuming-for poems he's promised- the
45 author
Next chooses his words; being dainty, and nice ot discern-
ment,
For distinction is gained, should he work out a neat combina-
tion,
Whereby what is trite may prove novel. Here too, should it
· happen,
That one must explain the complex by a term quite new·
iangled,
50 It follows that words once by cinctured Cethegus unheard of
May formed be. Nay, license is given to those who will
modestly use it:
And even the latest coined words have their weight when
they, haply,
Are Greek by descent, with but slight deviation.

· What would you!
Caecilius, and Plautus, should Romans accord what they,
Vergil,
And Varius, reiuse? And if Ibut some few words acquire,
55 why
Should 1 thus be envied, when seeing the speech oi both
Ennius
And Cato, our own native tongue has enriched, and ior old
things
New names has developed?
