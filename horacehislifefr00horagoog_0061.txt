Ona 3. XXVI.
(To Venus. Disappointment, Reform, and Revenge.)

Of late have I lived e’er tor maidens befitting,
Ay, fought e’en, full often—and not without glory:
But arms, now acquitted from warfare,
And lyre ton, this fair temple-wall holds
That ever the left flank of Venus, the Sea-born, 5
Keeps guard for. There-there, leave, resplendently shining,
My torcheS, and leverS, and bows, once,
⁸ of portals-resistant, a menace.
Thou, Goddess! who reign'st over fortunate Cyprus-
And Memphis, secure from Sithonian snows-pray 10
O Queen ! with thine uplifted rod, once,
The arrogant Chloe touch duIy.

Ona 1. XXXIV.
(The Poet's Creed: a Special Warning, and Refor-
mation.)

Begrudging the gods, and infrequent of worship,

. Was I, whilst Philosophers-senseless astray in

Pursuit of: yet, now, to return3 ay, to hasten,

With full-sail retracing all devious courses,

Compell'd arn. For, Jupiter Mighty the heavens 5
Hath fir’d with the flash of His lightnings: the clouds thus
Dividing, and eke through a pure sky oft driven

His thunderous horses, and swiftest, wing’d ehariots,
Whereby slnggish Earth, and her wandering rivers;

E’en Styx, and dread seats of the hateful Taenarus,

Or borders of far-off Atlantaean mountains,

Are shaken. Nay, ever, from highest to lowest

To change, and the lofty ahase‚ may the Father-

Or humblest uplift thus! Her crown, too, rapacious
Fortuna, with elattering rush, is delighted

Το snatch from the head of the one, for another.
