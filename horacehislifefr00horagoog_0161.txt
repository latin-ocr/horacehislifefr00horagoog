¹ (The Journey to Brundusium) v

Set forth from great Rome, first Aricia offered me welcome,
In hostelry modest-with Heliodorus, the Rhetor‚
Of Greeks far most learned-and thence to the Forum-Appii,
Aswarm with its watermen, as with the rascally vintners.
This journey we idly divide-though but one, tor those better 5
Begirded-the Appian thus much less troubling slow
trav'lerss
Here Ι next, because of the water, which vile was, my
stomach
Made war on: by no means with equable mind, when at sup-
Ρθΐ,
The company warching.
Lo, Night, to enshroud all the Earth 0’er
In shadows-the Heavens, with stars to besprinkle-prepares!
And, ιο
The servants with boatmen; the boatmen with servants, in
turn, their
Reflections exchange too-
“ 0 come, now !”-“ Three hundred you’ve let in ?”
‘⁴ Enough‚ there !'’
Whilst fares are collecting; our mule, as well, harness’d
An hour has vanish'd. The cursed mosquitoes and marsh
frogs,
Next tend off all sleeping, while sing-to their mistresses·
absent- 15
A Bargeman, well-soahed with stale wine, and some one of
our trav'lers‚
In contest. At length, when the passenger wearieS, by
slumber
