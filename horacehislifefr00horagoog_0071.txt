These Persian new Iashions, my b⁰X² I hate-ay,
Displease me all chaplets of linden bark woven !
Pray cease, then, thy quest for the latest blown roses

. In nooks that aloof are.
Let SImplest oi myrtles, with naught of art added,
Thy sedulous care be, for never, thus sarving,
Can these e'er degrade thee, norme, here at rest 'neath

The vine’s shade, imbibing.

I hate, then, the vulgar-profane: at a distance,
Aye keep them. Pray, silent, attend ye my verses
Unheard yet! A priest of the Muses,
For virgins, and boys, do I sing these-

For him, o’er whose impions neck a drawn sword is 17
Aye pendent, not ever e’en Banqnets Sicilian
May bring an agreeable relish:
Nor song-bird and lyre, with sweet music, 20
To slumber restore, nay, though slumber to rustics
Its balm ne'er disdains, eke in cottages humblest,
Or dim, shaded banks of the rivers·
And Tempe, where Zephyrs are stirring.

E'en proud, branen'd·TrirenieS, the Black Care,
That rides at the back of the horseman! 40
Since then, may not marbles of Phrygia, nor nse of
The purples that, haply, more bright than the sun are—

Sweet nard-for the mind bring repose thus,
