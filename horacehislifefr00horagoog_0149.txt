an overshadowing Vergil and Horace—such as may be ’
tightly leit aside. Maecenas, however indebted t0 the
far-resounding Horatian-trump for his chief chance of
enduring recollection, was none the less a man of
highest consequence, later to be the potent minister „
of great Augustus. Heliodorus, supposed to have been
a noted authority on the Grecian metres and lan·
’ guerra-and, by some authorities, to have been here
selected ior special assistance to Messenae, at Athens-is
not clearly defined in ascertained history, but Cocceius,
and Capito as well, thus make a considerable figure. It
is related ot the formes* that he, a well-known juriscon-

Plutarch has told us of this Capite, and of his escorting one

Cleopatra toan awaiting Antony: a pleasant duty, suggest-
ing a later idyl ot Launcelot and Guinevere, but equally
of peril, perhaps-unless the “Star-eyed Egyptian,” by

some modern process of historical rehahilitation‚ may
prove, after all, to have merited a Prix-deMonthyon.
Varius, just now enyoying a great and growing tame as a
writer oi epics, was, oi course, the remaining member oi
Maecenas’ famous triad oi domesticated poets,

That M. Janin’s French insight should also have dis-

Walckenaer, had already hinted that Maecenas was not
⁴ devoid oi good reasons ei his own for his present manner
of travel. But it is indeed strange, that, ol the other
commentatore Sir Theodora Martin alone seems to lay
stress upon the gravity ol the attendant crisis.

And yet, however serious the situation, there isne
clear evidence as to exactly what feature ot it this par-
ticular mission was, or whether, indeed, it certainly
concerned a proposed reconciliation between the contest·
