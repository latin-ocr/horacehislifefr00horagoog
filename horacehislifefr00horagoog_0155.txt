‘⁶ Grouse in the Gun-room,'’ and a thousand other by-gone
pleasantries-drift too heavily down our modern stream

M. Janin found this episode “ peu plaisante '’; Horace,
however, that thanks to it, “Prorsusjncnnde coenam
produximus illam.’' But, nevertheless, even wretched
horse-play of the kind, may, as already suggested, here

bluntness, such as are common enough on tense strnng

later languages in curiously distorted form. Thus, the
English, “a man tobis finger-tips,’' and the French
equivalent of ‘⁴ jusqu’au bout des ongles,” etc, although
