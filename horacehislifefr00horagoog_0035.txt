And laurel, so gathered3 nor lacking 20
The aid of the Gods, thus emboldened.
Thine am 1, ye Museo thine wholly, tho' lofty
Heights-Sabine I mount, or forme is the cooler
Praeneste, and slopes of fair Tibur,
Or waters of Baiae delightful.
1, friend of thy fountains and dances, lo, never
E'en Philippi’s back-driven ranks-and accursed
Tree’s fall-could extinguish3 nor yet might

In Sicily's wave, Palinurus!

gFROM ODE 2. XIII.

(On his Escape from a Falling Tree.)

A day evil-star'd, thou wert planted-and he too,
Whoever first reared thee, of hand sacrilegious—
Ο Tree, to posterity thus so
Destructive3 the Shame of our village!
His own father’s neck, now; I'm forced to believe that
He fractured as well, and his innermost chambers
By night, with the blood of his guests he
Bespattered: ay, poisonings·Colchian ;
And whatever wrong that can ever be thought of,
He practiced, who here in my field once upraised thee,
Thou vile log, thus ready to fall on
The head of an innocent master.
N ay, what should man shun best, there’s never enough then
Of waming, from honr to hour, of lifetime!
