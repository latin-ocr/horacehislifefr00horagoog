For else would none others the better be poems composing:
Yet, truly,

Small worth is it: therefore, 1’11 serve e’en as whetstone, in-
stead, to

Make steel more acute, if not able to cut3 and, moreover 305

Ι Both duty, and method—though not myself writing—teach
others: ’

Provide them with wealth, and what nurses and munds-out a
poet—

Becomes them, or not, and to virtue may tend, or make
error.

In writing‚ sound judgment the fount is; the principle,
ever:

And Socrates’ papers can guide you, for choice of a subject, 310

Whilst words not unwillingly follow, where themes are well
chosen.

He who's learn'd what he owesto his country, and what to a
friend, or

What love is for parent3 for brother; observance for
strangers;

A senator’s duty3 the task of a judge, or the burden

Of one sallied forth to the war as a general, 'tis certain 315

Will know with his characters each, how to draw and endow
them.

A scrutiny first, in the methods of nature and manneio, I'd
order,

That learn’d imitators may ,lifelike expressions deduce thence:

For sometimes mere commonplace sparkle, and morals well
marked, tho’

Inelegant, lift plays which lack both a just weight and art in
their structures, 320

And better exact from the peoplc delight, and attention,

Than verses more barren in trifles of tune, and of matter.
