equally unauthorized sarcasm, via: “ Tell the orazed Jews
such miracles‚’' etc.

Lord Ravensworth‚ another* of the most admired rhym-
ing translatore, admitted for himself the tullest license‚
under his theory of “the 'greces oi rhyme ''. In his
rendering ot the above mentioned Ode 1. Ι, no suggestion
appears as to the “trabe Cypria ’', the “pavidus nauta”‚
0r“indocilis pauperiem pati '’, while the“catulis a ἥ e
fidelibus” bave to be turned into “blood-hounds,” and
made to “ snuff the drag '', in order torhyme with “ stag”.
Worse still, after various like liberties with Ode 1. II, the
famous “ Te duce ansar’', and the equally admired “neu
sinas Medos equitare inultos ’' are diluted into

“And over rebel Media bear
'Phe Roman Eagle’s conquering wing '’

But license of this kind was nothing to the noble trans·
lator here concerned, for we find him presently crucifying
the two splendid verses at the end of Ode 1. VII,
Μ ³* e nunc vinopellite curas30ras ingens iterabimus
aequor ” as '
‘⁴ Fill high the sparkling bowI, your goblets drain,
Tomorrow3 cheered by wine, we'll boldly plow the main.''

In this case, the original suffered not only from the rhym-
ing process, but as well from an unhallowed—and unau-
thorined-suggestion of the fortes viri carrying over an
alcoholic stimulation from the feast until the next day.
Again‚ in what he boasted to be a line-tor-line render·

ing, (of Ode. 1. XII) Lord Ravenswortb did not hesitate to
iniecta new stanna, by way of ‘⁶ amplification ’' (as a con· '
trast to Willmot3 with Ode 2. IV, who left one out) with-
out which he found it impossible “to give its proper
value'' doc.

Here, at least (however equally appropriate the quo·

tation might be, in its most essential feature, to others ot
the rbyming expansionists) one is tempted to recall the
enquiry “ What do you read my Lord''t with Hamlet’s Ι,
concrete answer, ol “Words, words, words.” ”
