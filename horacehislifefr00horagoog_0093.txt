But come, what prevents our agreement may'st hear you!

Thus J, whom fine togas became once, and well-perfum’d
lockst00‚

Who grasping-Cinara could please, as you know, without
presente, y

And Falernian-pure drank from noon tide moreover‚ now
better

Light suppers rejoice in, with naps on the grass by thess
brook side: ¹

Unshamed of old sports, where the shame’s but in falling to
stop them.

And thus there is no one with envious eye my enjoyments

To lessen; to poison with hatred obscure, or with slander,

But smile, do my neighbors when turn Ι the clods, or the
boulders.

This once was my longing : a portion of land, not excessive,

Where might be my root, near a garden; aspring neuer-
failing,

And snug little wood, close beside them. But better, and fuller,

The gods have endowed me. T'is well then! Nor aught
further crave I,

O Son of Fair Maia l—unles's thou'lt these blessings aye save,5
me.

If I've never made my estate yet the greater, by evil,

Nor ever shall lessen it either, by vice or ill-doing3

It ne’er Ι may stupidly offer such pray’rs as “ O would that

This neighboring spot were but added, which bounds my
small field now,'’
