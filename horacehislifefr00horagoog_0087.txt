In ideas fraternal: whatever the one may deny, both

Denying, or nodding assent, as old doves well-acquaint might. 5

Keep you to your nest, then, whilst I, in my turn, praise de-
lights of

'Phe rivers and mess-covered rocks, and a grove of the
country.

Nay‚ ask you my reason? Ilive, andI reign, thus, on quit·
ting

What you to the heavens extol witha joy’d acclamation3

Ay, much as the run-away slave of the priest, once his wasers 10

Rejected: for plain bread I long, as far better than honeyed.

To live suiting Nature, it this should behove one, now truly-

Where sites must be sought for one's dwelling, as first of
requirements—

Pray know you a place better fitting than is my bles’t country?

And could there be winters more mild, or where breezes more
gracious, 15

Best sotten the fury of Dogstar, or Leo’s mutatione,

When first, in a rage, he has felt the keen darts of the sun-
rays? ,

And where may invidious care now, least hamper one’s slum·
bers:

Is grass e’er less fragrant and shining than Libyan pavementS‚

And purer the water, resisting lead-pipes oi the street, than 20

In streams that the rills here with tremulous murmurs
descend by?

No doubt your plantation is fostered, amidst varied columne,

Your house, as well, praised for its outlook on far-streteb-

But llllitsririrgsayzomark you, expelled by the pitchtorlr‚ return

makes
And silently breaks vain repulsions, in conquest triumphant. 25

Lo, these, by Vacuna’s old mouldering temple, indite I, 49
Full happy meanwhile, saving only that you are not with me.
