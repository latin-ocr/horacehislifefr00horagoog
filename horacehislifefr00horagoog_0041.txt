But harsher events from that place oi great pleasures re-
moved me,

By civil-war whirled, tho’ a novice at arms, in its current,

And Caesar Augustus unable to eope with in sinews.

Then, soon as Ι next was dismissed by the Philippi battle-

01 wings clipt, and humble, and stripped alas, both of paternal 50

Laud-tenure and root-tree-a poverty daring impell’d to

The making of verses.

But now, what’s not needed thus having,
How could aught to purge me be able; what doses of hemlock,
If thought I not better to rest, than to scrihble my verses?
Alas too, all things trom us steal, do the years that are
waning, , 55
And jests having snatch’d-with my gallantries, revels, and

sportings—

' Το wrest e'en my poems they strive now. What would you
I'd do, then?

* 'k * 'k * 'k ἃ

Yet passing all such things! My poems in Rome, still, be-
think you, ⁶5

I’m able to write, amidst all of its toils and cares too?

· First, one calls for bail, eke another, to heed to his writings—

My matters then dropped-ill’s the next, on the Mount of
Quirinus3

A fourth, at the Aventine's end, tho' be visited each must:

With distances, mark yon, thus charmingly handy! 70
ι Yes, true that

Quite clear are the streets, so that nothing obstructs medi-
tanen,

But, breathless-with mules, and with porters—first hastens
abuilder3

Uplift next a stone, will the crane, or a huge balk of timber,

While funerals-dismal combat with rude drays for the
passage.

Anon, a mad dog's ssight, or rush oi some filthy sow onward* 75
