'doings which are charged against the rhyming transla-
tors. Here, ior convenience, one can lump these features,
together with such collateralvagaries as attend their pres-
ence in the shape of tendencies to wander, and improvo,
and interpolate, or, it may be to instruct.

Thus we find Gladstono presenting tho fine verse (of
Ode 1. ΙΙ) “Erycina ridens quam Jocus circum volat et
Cupido '’, as “fair Venus ⁴* ⁴* ἥ to laugh with Sport
and Cupid taught'’, in order to rhyme with “ Mars our own
founder e ἥ ⁴⁶ thou be worth a thought”; the latter
phrase, in turn, being bodily expanded from “ Respicis
auctor ''. Again, in the same poem, one sees the stately
war-occupation of this last mentioned De'ity, “ ludo, quem
juvat clamor ’', belittled into “thy game of shout'', while
“nevete ἦ ³⁶ ⁴⁶ ocior aura ὕ ³⁶ tollat '’ is common-
ized as “nor earlier take thy passage home.”, by way of
matchingup the desired jingle with ‘⁸ Rome ’³ in the next·
but-one preceding line. Worse still, however, as an ex-
ample of the “ Reltraint of Rhime ”, is a mutilation of the
world-renowned invocation at the end, viz, “te duce,

Caesar '’, into “ While Caesar lives, and lives to reign '’-to
mate with “gain ''. And, as a final example from this
writer, we have the quaint conceit of “a perjured punk’'
-whatever this may'be—to rhyme with “drunk '', asan
equivalent of the “ meretrix ’' in Ode 1. XXXV.

The learned Professor Porson's rendering oi the dra·

matic Ode 1, XXVII; curiously enough deemed worthy of
high place in the Bibliophile Society Edition‚ will serve as
an example of extreme and tasteless mutilation of another
kind: that of adaptation to a modern flavor, with flippancy
of humor, and speech. Its faults are too manifold to
quote in extenso, but one of the customary constraints of
rhyming, under such treatment, may well be noted. Thus,
“Natis in usum laetitiae scyphis '’ must needs be expanded
-if only to secure the poorest of rhymes-to

“ My friends were glasses made for fighting,
· And not your heads and hearts to lighten ?”

Here too, “tollite barbarum morem '' comes out of the
