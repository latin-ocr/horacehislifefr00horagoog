(To Quintius, A description ol the Poet's Sabine

Farm.)

Don’t ask me, most excellent Quintius if truly my land
may

The corn forits owner supply, and with olives enrich him-

As well as with orchards and pastures; with elm trees all
vine clad—

Since fully I write this, and eke oi it’s form and its aspect.

Thus, mountains unbroken‚ except as divide them a shaded 5

Vale only, so turn’d that its right· flank the Sun comesto
gaze at,

And left one, alike by his chariot's flitting e’er warmed too,

With mildness you’d welcome. Nay‚ what ii my brambles
prolific, .

'- Bear plums and red comels; if oali-nee, and holm-bush‚

With ample ior flockS, and due shade ior their owner, provide 10
now?

You’d say that Tarentum in bloom is brought nearer! And,
look you

Aiountain here, als0; befitting the name oi a river,

That Hebrus’ windings in Thrace ne'er shows eooler or
clearer‚

Thus flowing for aid oi weak heads, audior stomachs dis·
ordered.

Here, then, are retreats, pray believe me, attractive and15
lovely‚

And sate for you, ever, in menacing hours oi September.
