'Po live, I'd be willing3 forgot, and forgetting of friends t00‚

Whilst Neptune, from dryland safe viewing afar in histo
fury.

But still, one from Capua, Rome-ward, who’s both rain and
mud splashed,

Would hardly to live at an inn then be willing, nor does
he-

A eoldhaving taken—the stoves and the bagniosproclaim thus,

As fully, and always, for lives that are happy providing.

So neither, though toss'd in the deep by a violent south-wind, 15¹

Must therefore you sell out your ship, when you've cross'd the
Aegean.

Nay, Rhodes and Mytilene-beauteouS, on one sound of mind,
may

Effect have, like cloaks in midsummer‚ or drawers of an
athlete

In snow-time; the Tiberin winter; a fire in August. ’

Thus, while t'is permitted‚ and Fortune’s benignant, aye 20
praise you

Fair Samos and Chios3 far Rhodes too, if still you at Rome are

And whatever hours of welfare the gods may vouchsafe you,

Receive with a hand that is grateful, nor wait years for
pleasureS,

To say that wherever you’ve lived,you have found satisfac·
tion.

For, mark you, if reason, and likewise discretion-in lieu of 25

A place with a sea-view—one's cares may remove thus, it
follows,

The heavens, instead of the soul‚ change with those who the
seas cross.

T'is ever an idleness·busy that vexes, With yachts, and

With coacheS, we're seeking to live well: but what you make
quest of,

Is ltere, at Ulubrae‚ if haply, good temper ne'er fails you. 30
