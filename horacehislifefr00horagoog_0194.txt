Another like inflation occurs in Ode 3. XXX (“ Exegi
monumentum ” dcc.) where “multaque pars mei vitabit
Libitinam ”, is opened out, and “ improved,” as follows :

“Some part,
Nor that a little, shall
Escape the dark destroyer’s dart
And her grim festival.‘'

again, in the reference to the infancy-episode, in Ode 3. IV,
when Horace was ‘⁸ non sine dis animosus infans’' he makes
the poet proclaim himself “no craven-bearted child.’'

Finally, in Sir Theodore's rendering of Ode 3. IX—tbe
well-known dialogus between Horace and Lydia—we find
two of the most characteristic expressions of the original,
“tu levior cortice '’ and “iracundior'’, respectively dis-
guised by “ fickle as an April sky ” and “ more churlish.”

So much for some of the quaint notione and practices
of the rhymesters, taken hastily, and rather at hap-hazard,
but purposely restricted to the most eminent of their ex·
ponents, and to the poems which are sought more faith-
fully to be dealt with in my own present experimenta.

One would be tempted to pursue this interesting investi-
gation, and its array of proofs, to a greater extent, but
for tbe fact that, with so many examples, and such num-
bers of offenders to examine, the task would lead too far in
time and space.

These, however, who may desire further to investigate
the subiect will find the labor slight, and the material
ample, since any translation of the kind, even without the
original at hand for comparison, will necessarily show its
rhyme-structure‚ and the shifts and changes which were
observed in hammering out those “ graoes '’ of which we
have heard so much, and-in the field of classic transla-
tion at least-have been so long, and so curiously‚ the
victims.

Thus we leave the few illustrations from the rhym-
ing translatore which limitatione of space and =range
of enquiry hero permit. But it may appropriately be

remarked‚ that, however plsasing the performances of
, these gentlemen, when reckoned as independent poems-
