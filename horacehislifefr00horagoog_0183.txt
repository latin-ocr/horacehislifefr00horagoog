“The extant manuscripts of Horace, about two hundred
and fifty in number ⁴* * a No satisfactory classification
has yet been discovered, which shall enable us to decide on
disputed readings by the weight of manuscript testimony3
nor is it probable that the relations of the manuscripts to one
enother can ever be sufficiently made out to establish such a
classification. Owing to the practice in which copyists and
revisers often indulged, of comparing their codex with one
or more otherS, and borrowing readings from these at their
discretion, the lines of tradition have become so confused
that it is probably no longer possible to separate them.
a * ⁴* The serious problems of Horatian textual criticism
involve, as a rule, the choice between two (seldom three) va-
riante, each resting on good but not conclusive, manuscript

support; and the decision cannot be reached by any balancin g
of authorities, but calls for the exercise of sound judgment,
trained by careful study of the poet’s mode of thought and
habit of expression.”

-Surrrr, (Prof. C. L.).

“³³ ³* ⁴* The task is so difficult of translating Horace in
any way, that no sensible man will lay down rigid rules as to
what‘ways' are admissible, and what not. ³* ⁴* ⁴* In fact,
though we are ready to welcome excellence, whether in the
literal, paraphrastical, or intermediate methodS, the predomi·
nant caution a ⁴* * is, that it is really translation, the
reproduction of Horace himself, which is to be desired, and
the great danger ultimately is his who thinks himself en-
titled to take liberties and to overlook details ⁴* ⁴* *''
