“ Horatii cariosa felicitas—this, one of the earliest criticisms
made on the Odes, remains the phrase which most completely
describes their value. Such minute elaboration, on so nar-
< row a range of subject and within such confined limits of
thought and feeling, could only be relieved from dullness by

a poet who suddenly flashes out a golden phrase, but more

of translucent stone.'' -Mlcrln,
