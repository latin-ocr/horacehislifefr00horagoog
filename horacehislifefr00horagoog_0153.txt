Horace tells us of the haste to leave Fundi (perhaps,
like Cicero's departure from Rome of a few years earlier,
“before daylight‚ to avoid all gazing and gossip'')²⁹
· where lay in wait that officious Jack-in-office, Aufidius
Lusco, who, by the way, does not appear to have been
actually met, in person. But the poet has nothing what·
ever to say of any local, official-receptione, such as Maece-
nas would ordinarily have received along the route. In
point of fact, the singular reticence of the narrative on
all political or public matters, which has been sometimes
rather captiously remarked, would seem to sufficiently
indicate that there was ample need and excuse for the
studied caution thus ohserved throughout and concerning
. the journey.

That Horace himself had abundant grounds for his

guarded report and discroet comment, quite asido from
what may have here been enjoined upon him, as likewise
for the minutest circumspectior] of personal demeanor at
this particular period, is equally obvious 'fhe times
were parlous; it behooved to gang warily. Especially
if one valued one's head, where those of greater ap·
parent consequence were falling, on all sides, like au-
tumn leaves.³⁰ A bolder life, as at Philippi, like his
shield on the same occasion, had been tried hy our poet,
, and found wanting,³³1 inconsistent, perhaps, with that
epicuream philosophy he was about to more fully embrace.
Then, t00, he was but newly taken-on by the great Maece·

’ ill-fated attachment to Brutus, and also overcome an ob·
scurity of origin which was only too apparent in thebright
light of his present exalted associatione.

Turning now, to the approximately metrica] rendering
of Sat. Ι, v, herewith supplied, it is hoped that this may
find excuse in its close and self-denying observance of the
text of the original story, and, in such aspect, sufficiently
serve, as'suggested for the purpose of convenient present
reference.

It finds its modest genesis in this apparent need, and
