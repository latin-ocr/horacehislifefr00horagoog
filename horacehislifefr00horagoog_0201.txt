Out oi all the Horace-translators of the kind (Hoven
den, perhaps excepted), the German, Arnold, seems to
have more nearly anticipated the close-ordered, and rigid,
faithfulness here attempted, at least so far as his above
cited version ottho Epistle to the Pisos is concerned.
Baths, too, like the others last indicated, whatever may
have been the difference of degree between them, never-
theless failed adequately to avoid a certain undue freedom
of rearrangement, or of substitution-a licence indeed,
which even characterizes the work oi many of the prose
translators.

Ae here restricted in extended comment‚I must re-
irain from discussion oi Lord Lytton's fine work, or of
what Newman’s might well have been had he shown less
eccentricity-and must likewise pass that of Seweh, with
the schoolmast'er aspect in which it was purposely clothed.
These earlier reformers, however original and progressive
their reiorms may have been, were douhtless impressed and
restrained by their environment, or by what in certain
forms of a more mechanical development ie technically
known as “ the state oi the art ’' of their period.

In any case, it may be observed that since their time,
and particularly of late, there has certainly been a rapidly
diminished flow of rhymed translation, together with a ,
marked suggestion of increased effort at that greater sim-
plicity and straightiorwardness in translation methods
which begins with sloughing off the unwholesonre and
belittling excrescence of rhyme.i
