attained we

To Barium's walls, ever-fishy: and e’en where Egnatia-

First built when the nymphs were in wrath—gave us laugh-

Since there, in the temple’s: porch, fireleSS, could incense be

unruffled, 100

gods

Will ne'er to send down such {rom heaven’s high-towers be
anxious.

But here—with Brundusium-ends my long paper, and
Journey.
