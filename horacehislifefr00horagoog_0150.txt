ants Antony aud Octavianus. Horace’s own account, as
may be observed, is discreetly silent in this regard. We
Ι have from him the iact that a Journey from Rome to
Brundusium was thus made, iu association with the ex-
perienced harmonizers here specified, and on weighty

concerns: “Maecenas . . . atque Cocceius missi magnis
de rebuS,” and “aversos soliti componere amicos.'’ But
otherwise there is only scanty light ior the guidance of
those who may further eeek to investigate the point under
the obscuring miste ot antiquity.

lt is known that Maecenas was charged with an em-
bassy ot like purpose, resulting in the Peace of Brundusium,
of B. Ο. 40, between the same parties in controversy, but
it is equally well established that Horace had not thus
early been admitted to the charmed circle oi the great
man’s friends, aud that he therefore could hardly then
have accompanied him.¹⁸

If, however. astho weight oi earlier authority and of
much opinion seems to incline, the present journey, which
must have occurred about B. Ο. 37, concerned a so-called

treaty oi Tarentum,-whither Antony had gone with his ·

fieet oi ¹three hundred vessels, on being ill-received at
Brundusium—the case is simpler, since by this time our
poet was duly oi the elect, as a protege of Maecenas and
thus qualified to join and repert his embassy.

In a careful summing up of the attaiuable evidence

affecting these questions, Dean Wickham seems to find ’

the matter still open for debete, and, it should be ob·
eerved, even approvingly cites an alternative hypothesis
(oi Shiitz¹ ⁹) to the effect that whatever meeting there may
have been with Antony, as to this latter treaty‚ occurred
at Athens. the concern oi Horace therein being probably
no more than to accompany his chief to a convenient
Italian port oi emberkation.2⁰ However this may be,
there is another salient feature oi the interesting
narrative which seems to have escaped the notice oi all
the commentatore except the acute Frenchman first above
reterredt. This is the truly extraordinary difference
