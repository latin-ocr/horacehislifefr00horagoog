cult one, especially where “ views '' oi Horace are con·
eerned. Asa matter of fact, such views, and his reflectione
generally, are so scattered and blended throughout the
poema that it is next to impossible to fairly present them
without a fuller quotation of the original material than is
here practicable.

But, aiter all, one finds the chief features oi the char-
acteristIc Horatian philosophy and of the poet’s ex-
periences in the poems or extracts therefrom thus dealt
with. And whatever omission there may be, will, at
least, save a certain amount ol repetition.

I have thus far more particularly referred to the longer
posms. As to the shorter ones, the present selection is
made with a view rather oi presenting those only that
possess a distinctly persona] element, whether oi an auto·
biographical nature, or as reflectingsentiments of more im-
mediate persoual application. Such a limitation, in one or
the other oi its aspects, excludes Sic te diva potera (1,
ΙΙΙ.) 0 novis referrent re, (1, XIV.) Archytas3 (1,
XXVIII.) the charming, however artificial, and abstract‚
Epode ΙΙΙ Beatos ille, qut procul nepotir‘3,· Quem tu
Melpomene, (4, ΙΙΙ.), the sacred Hymn, and adoneu other
striking and famous exemplos. And yet, these are the
poems one is chiefly tempted to essay, even at the risk of
such mishaps as Ι have myseli thus far encountored in
trying the Amoebaean ode--tbe renowned dlalogue be·
tween Horace and Lydia (3, ΙΧ)-ειη(1 some of the epodos,
with others oi the more complex or dainty metrieal forms
and compositious.

That Ihave neglected to include certam of the amatory
pieoes may be observed. This is because on analysis these
would seem, as more or less unreal abstractione, to be
somewhat wide oi the present mark, asido from the lact
that the flavor oi sundry oi them does not appear to
survive in any permissible translation, however striking
and otherwise attractiva the poems iu question may be in
the original text.
